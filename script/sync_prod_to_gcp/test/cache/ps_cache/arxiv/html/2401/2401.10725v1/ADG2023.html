<p>
  Automated Deduction in Geometry (ADG) is a forum to exchange ideas
  and views, to present research results and progress, and to
  demonstrate software tools at the intersection between geometry and
  automated deduction. Relevant topics include (but are not limited
  to): polynomial algebra, invariant and coordinate-free methods;
  probabilistic, synthetic, and logic approaches, techniques for
  automated geometric reasoning from discrete mathematics,
  combinatorics, and numerics; interactive theorem proving in
  geometry; symbolic and numeric methods for geometric computation,
  geometric constraint solving, automated generation/reasoning and
  manipulation with diagrams; design and implementation of geometry
  software, automated theorem provers, special-purpose tools,
  experimental studies; applications in mechanics, geometric
  modelling, CAGD/CAD, computer vision, robotics, and education.
</p>

<p>
  Traditionally, the conference is held every two years. The previous
  editions of ADG were held in Hagenberg 2021, postponed from 2020,
  and held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nanning in 2018,
  Strasbourg in 2016, Coimbra in 2014, Edinburgh in 2012, Munich in
  2010, Shanghai in 2008, Pontevedra in 2006, Gainesville in 2004,
  Hagenberg in 2002, Zurich in 2000, Beijing in 1998, and Toulouse in
  1996.
</p>

<p>
  The 14th edition, ADG 2023, was held in Belgrade, Serbia, in
  September 20-22, 2023
  (<a href="https://adg2023.matf.bg.ac.rs/">ADG2023</a>). This edition
  of ADG had an additional special focus topic: Deduction in
  Education.
<p>
  
<p>
  The invited speakers at ADG 2023 were:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Julien Narboux, University of Strasbourg, France
  </li>
  <li>
    Filip Mari&cacute;, University of Belgrade, Serbia
  </li>
  <li>
    Zlatan Magajna, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia 
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The quality of research articles submitted for this proceedings of
  ADG was very high. Out of seventeen full-papers submitted, fifteen
  were accepted. Each submission was carefully reviewed by, at least,
  three reviewers. Therefore this volume consists of fifteen articles,
  bringing exciting new ideas, spanning various areas of automated
  deduction in geometry, and showing the current state-of-the-art
  research in this field.
</p>

<p>
  The conference programme and this volume can be roughly divided into
  3 parts.
<p>  

<p>
  <b>Automated and interactive theorem proving in geometry</b>
</p>

<p>
  The effort of formalise many areas of mathematics using deduction
  tools such as proof assistants is a huge undertaking, the area of
  geometry is part of that effort. The two invited talks, by Julien
  Narbox, <em>Formalisation, arithmetization and automatisation of
  geometry</em> and by Filip Mari&cacute;, <em>Automatization,
  formalization and visualization of hyperbolic geometry</em> gave a
  very good account of those efforts with the second also introducing
  an important subject, somehow less common to see, of the
  non-Euclidean geometries.
</p>

<p>
  The subject of readability of the proofs when automated or
  interactive theorem prover are used is addressed in several
  contributions.  Nicolas Magaud addresses the problem by presenting a
  framework to carry out a posteriori script transformations
  of <em>Coq</em> proof scripts. Vesna Marinkovi&cacute; et
  al. demonstrate how their triangle construction
  solver <em>ArgoTriCS</em> can cooperate with automated theorem
  provers for first order logic and coherent logic so that it
  generates construction correctness proofs, that are both
  human-readable and formal. Salwa Tabet Gonzalez et al. present a
  framework for completing incomplete conjectures and incomplete
  proofs. The proposed framework can also help in completing a proof
  sketch into a human-readable and machine-check-able proofs.
</p>

<p>
  The systems combining dynamic geometry and automated deduction are
  very important, when the aim is to reach a larger audience than the
  automated deduction experts. A first paper by Zolt&aacute;n
  Kov&aacute;cs et al. describes some on-going improvements concerning
  the automated reasoning tools developed in <em>GeoGebra Discovery</em>. A
  second paper by Zolt&aacute;n Kov&aacute;cs et al. describes the
  efforts that are being made to resume the development of <em>JGEX</em>, a
  system that combines the dynamic geometry system with several
  automated theorem provers and with natural language, with links to
  visual animations, human-readable proofs.
</p>

<p>
  Milan Bankovi&cacute; presents an approach to automated solving of
  triangle ruler-and-compass construction problems using finite-domain
  constraint solvers. Pierre Boutry et al. present their progress
  towards obtaining an independent version of Tarski's System of
  Geometry, in the form of a variant of Gupta's system. Pedro Quaresma
  et al. make some considerations on Approaches and Metrics in
  Automated Theorem Generation/Finding in Geometry, addressing Wos'
  Problem 31, about the properties that can be identified to permit an
  automated reasoning program to find new and interesting theorems.
</p>

<p>
  <b>The special focus topic Deduction in Education</b>

<p>
  This special focus topic addresses the several difficulties, or
  should we say, opportunities, that must be addressed to open the
  field of automated deduction to a wider audience, namely to the
  education community. The talks were all around the tools and
  problems crossing dynamic geometry systems and automated
  deduction. In the invited talk by Zlatan Magajna, <em>OK
  Geometry</em>, he presents a tool for analysing dynamic geometric
  constructions, observing invariants of dynamic geometric
  constructions, and generating conjectures. Philip Todd and Danny
  Aley present <em>GXWeb</em> in the context of proving and
  mathematical modelling, Zolt&aacute;n Kov&aacute;cs and other
  researchers use <em>GeoGebra</em>, <em>GeoGebra Discovery</em>
  and <em>JGEX</em> to address several problems in mathematical
  competitions. In two <em>STEAM</em> activities, Anna
  K&auml;ferb&ouml;ck and Zolt&aacute;n Kov&aacute;cs present an
  activity, finding the locus of a rocking camel and Thierry
  Dana-Picard et al. present the visualisation of 2D and 3D curves,
  with various technologies to use the motivational fascination of
  outer space from students to connect to mathematical modelling.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Algebraic methods in automated reasoning in geometry</b>
</p>

<p>
  Philip Todd examine a class of geometric theorems on cyclic 2n-gons,
  proving that if n disjoint pairs of sides are taken, each pair
  separated by an even number of polygon sides, then there is a linear
  combination of the angles between those sides which is
  constant. Hoon Hong et al. present a piece-wise rational
  reparameterization of curves obtaining a more uniform angular speed
  obtaining a better rational parameterization of those curves.
</p>

<p>
  The quality of this proceedings is due to the invited lecturers and
  the authors of submitted papers, but also to the reviewers, the
  members of the program committee, and all the organisers of ADG
  2023.

<b>Julien Narboux</b> (<i>University of Strasbourg, France</i>)
<p>
<p>
  In this talk we will present an overview of our work (with Michael
  Beeson, Pierre Boutry, Gabriel Braun and Charly Gries) about
  formalization and automation of geometry and the GeoCoq library. We
  will delve into the axiomatic systems of influential mathematicians
  such as Euclid, Hilbert and Tarski and present formalization
  issues. A special focus will be placed on the formalization of
  continuity axioms and parallel postulates.
</p>

<p>
  We will highlight details and issues that can be seen only through
  the lens of a proof assistant and intuitionist logic. We will
  present a syntactic proof of the independence of the parallel
  postulate.
</p>

<p>
  From axiomatic foundations to computer-assisted proofs, we will
  explore the intricate interplay between synthetic and analytic
  geometry, and different kinds of automation.

<b>Filip Mari&#x0107;</b> (<i>University of Belgrade, Serbia</i>)
<p>
<p>
  In this talk we describe our experiences with the formalization,
  automation and visualization of non-Euclidean geometries.
</p>

<p>
  We start with a formalization of the complex projective line CP(1)
  (also known as the extended complex plane), its objects (points and
  circlines) and transformations (M&ouml;bius transformations). An
  algebraic approach is used, where points are described with
  homogeneous coordinates, circlines are described with Hermitean
  matrices and M&ouml;bius transformations are described using regular
  matrices. We use the unit disk in CP(1) for the formalization of the
  Poincar&eacute; disk model of hyperbolic geometry and show that it
  satisfies all Tarski axioms of geometry (with the negated Euclidean
  axiom).
</p>

<p>
  We also analyze the problem of automatic construction of triangles
  in absolute and hyperbolic geometry. For this purpose we adapt the
  software <em>ArgoTriCS</em>. For the visualization of the generated
  constructions we use <em>ArgoDG</em>: a lightweight JavaScript library
  for dynamic geometry.
</p>
 
<p>
  Finally, we introduce the formalization of gyrogroups and gyrovector
  spaces introduced by Abraham Ungar, which is an alternative approach
  to formalize hyperbolic geometry inspired by Einstein's special
  theory of relativity.
</p>

<b>Zlatan Magajna</b> (<i>University of Ljubljana, Slovenia</i>)
<p>
<p>
  Automated observation of dynamic constructions is based on numerical
  checks of a variety of geometric properties performed on multiple
  instances of dynamic constructions, where all free points are
  continuously dragged. Unlike most dynamic geometry systems that
  incorporate some elements of observation, <em>OK Geometry</em> is a
  tool developed specifically for the purpose of automated observation
  of dynamic constructions. The goal of the observations is not to
  prove facts, but to generate plausible hypotheses about the
  properties of the observed construction.
</p>

<p>
  In the presentation, we focused on two aspects of observation in
  addition to the very concept of automated observation. Firstly, we
  considered the necessary functionalities of software for automated
  observation. The functionalities range from the possibility of
  importing dynamic constructions from different dynamic systems, to
  the management of a database of geometric facts, objects and
  properties to be considered during the observation, from the
  possibility of creating implicitly defined geometric objects to the
  importance of controlling computational errors in numerical checks.
</p>

<p>
  The second focus of the presentation was on the relationship between
  automated observation, proving and automated provers. Automated
  observation can be helpful in proving geometric facts as it brings
  to light properties of a configuration that one may not be aware
  of. In classroom practice, however, students have difficulty
  selecting the relevant facts among those automatically observed. It
  seems that automated observation is particularly useful in
  combination with automated provers when exploring geometric
  configurations. Automated observation generates (many) plausible
  hypotheses about the properties of a geometric configuration that
  can be proved with a prover.
