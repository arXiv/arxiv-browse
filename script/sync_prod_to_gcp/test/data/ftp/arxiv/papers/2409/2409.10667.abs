  Differential privacy (DP) is widely employed to provide privacy protection
for individuals by limiting information leakage from the aggregated data. Two
well-known models of DP are the central model and the local model. The former
requires a trustworthy server for data aggregation, while the latter requires
individuals to add noise, significantly decreasing the utility of aggregated
results. Recently, many studies have proposed to achieve DP with Secure
Multi-party Computation (MPC) in distributed settings, namely, the distributed
model, which has utility comparable to central model while, under specific
security assumptions, preventing parties from obtaining others' information.
One challenge of realizing DP in distributed model is efficiently sampling
noise with MPC. Although many secure sampling methods have been proposed, they
have different security assumptions and isolated theoretical analyses. There is
a lack of experimental evaluations to measure and compare their performances.
We fill this gap by benchmarking existing sampling protocols in MPC and
performing comprehensive measurements of their efficiency. First, we present a
taxonomy of the underlying techniques of these sampling protocols. Second, we
extend widely used distributed noise generation protocols to be resilient
against Byzantine attackers. Third, we implement discrete sampling protocols
and align their security settings for a fair comparison. We then conduct an
extensive evaluation to study their efficiency and utility.
