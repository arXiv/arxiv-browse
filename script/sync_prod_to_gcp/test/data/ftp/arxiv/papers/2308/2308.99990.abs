  This research paper presents an in-depth analysis of the current landscape of software security,
focusing on the evolving nature of vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of contemporary defense
mechanisms. As software complexity increases, so does the potential for exploitable weaknesses,
making it imperative to understand and anticipate emerging threats. This study first categorizes
the most prevalent types of vulnerabilities found in modern software applications, drawing from
a dataset of reported security breaches and exploits from the past five years. These
vulnerabilities are analyzed in the context of various software environments, including web, mobile,
and cloud-based platforms.
