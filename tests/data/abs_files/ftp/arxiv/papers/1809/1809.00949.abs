  Unrecognized hazards increase the likelihood of workplace fatalities and
injuries substantially. However, recent research has demonstrated that a large
proportion of hazards remain unrecognized in dynamic construction environments.
Recent studies have suggested a strong correlation between viewing patterns of
workers and their hazard recognition performance. Hence, it is important to
study and analyze the viewing patterns of workers to gain a better
understanding of their hazard recognition performance. The objective of this
exploratory research is to explore hazard recognition as a visual search
process to identifying various visual search factors that affect the process of
hazard recognition. Further, the study also proposes a framework to develop a
vision based tool capable of recording and analyzing viewing patterns of
construction workers and generate feedback for personalized training and
proactive safety management.
