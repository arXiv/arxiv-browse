  Analysis of geospatial data has traditionally been model-based, with a mean
model, customarily specified as a linear regression on the covariates, and a
covariance model, encoding the spatial dependence. We relax the strong
assumption of linearity and propose embedding neural networks directly within
the traditional geostatistical models to accommodate non-linear mean functions
while retaining all other advantages including use of Gaussian Processes to
explicitly model the spatial covariance, enabling inference on the covariate
effect through the mean and on the spatial dependence through the covariance,
and offering predictions at new locations via kriging. We propose NN-GLS, a new
neural network estimation algorithm for the non-linear mean in GP models that
explicitly accounts for the spatial covariance through generalized least
squares (GLS), the same loss used in the linear case. We show that NN-GLS
admits a representation as a special type of graph neural network (GNN). This
connection facilitates use of standard neural network computational techniques
for irregular geospatial data, enabling novel and scalable mini-batching,
backpropagation, and kriging schemes. Theoretically, we show that NN-GLS will
be consistent for irregularly observed spatially correlated data processes. To
our knowledge this is the first asymptotic consistency result for any neural
network algorithm for spatial data. We demonstrate the methodology through
simulated and real datasets.
