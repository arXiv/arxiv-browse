  Blind face restoration usually relies on facial priors, such as facial
geometry prior or reference prior, to restore realistic and faithful details.
However, very low-quality inputs cannot offer accurate geometric prior while
high-quality references are inaccessible, limiting the applicability in
real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose GFP-GAN that leverages rich and
diverse priors encapsulated in a pretrained face GAN for blind face
restoration. This Generative Facial Prior (GFP) is incorporated into the face
restoration process via novel channel-split spatial feature transform layers,
which allow our method to achieve a good balance of realness and fidelity.
Thanks to the powerful generative facial prior and delicate designs, our
GFP-GAN could jointly restore facial details and enhance colors with just a
single forward pass, while GAN inversion methods require expensive
image-specific optimization at inference. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves superior performance to prior art on both synthetic and
real-world datasets.
