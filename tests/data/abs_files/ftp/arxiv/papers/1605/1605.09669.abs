  This paper presents an interactive fuzzy goal programming (FGP) approach for
solving multiobjective nonlinear programming problems (MONLPP) with interval
type 2 fuzzy numbers (IT2 FNs). The cost and time of the objective functions,
the resources, and the requirements of each kind of resources are taken to be
trapezoidal IT2 FNs. Here, the considered problem is first transformed into an
equivalent crisp MONLPP, and then the transformed MONLPP is converted into an
equivalent Multiobjective Linear Programming Problem (MOLPP). By using a
procedure based on Taylor series, this problem is reduced into a single
objective linear programming problem (LPP) which can be easily solved by Maple
18.02 optimization toolbox. Finally, the proposed solution procedure is
illustrated by two numerical examples.
