  The review of recent developments in the unconventional superconductivity
theory is given. In the fist part I consider the physical origin of the Kerr
rotation polarization of light reflected from the surface of superconducting
$Sr_2RuO_4$. Then the comparison of magneto-optical responses in
superconductors with orbital and spin spontaneous magnetization is presented.
The latter result is applied to the estimation of the magneto-optical
properties of neutral superfluids with spontaneous magnetization. The second
part is devoted to the natural optical activity or gyrotropy properties of
noncentrosymmetric metals in their normal and superconducting states. The
temperature behavior of the gyrotropy coefficient is compared with the
temperature behavior of paramagnetic susceptibility determining the noticeable
increase of the paramagnetic limiting field in noncentrosymmetric
superconductors. In the last chapter I describe the order parameter and the
symmetry of superconducting state in the itinerant ferromagnet with
orthorhombic symmetry. Finally the Josephson coupling between two adjacent
ferromagnet superconducting domains is discussed.
