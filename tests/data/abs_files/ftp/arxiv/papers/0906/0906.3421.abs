  In the first part of this paper, we provide a concise review of our method of
solution of the $A_r$ Q-systems in terms of the partition function of paths on
a weighted graph. In the second part, we show that it is possible to modify the
graphs and transfer matrices so as to provide an explicit connection to the
theory of planar networks introduced in the context of totally positive
matrices by Fomin and Zelevinsky. As an illustration of the further generality
of our method, we apply it to give a simple solution for the rank 2 affine
cluster algebras studied by Caldero and Zelevinsky.
