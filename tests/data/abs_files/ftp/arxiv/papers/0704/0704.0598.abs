  Despite their claimed biological plausibility, most self organizing networks
have strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take into
account a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution is
conditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the
structural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen
in a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise
affected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility
of emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to
different inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas
(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending
on the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is
considered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local
and global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly
adapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis
shows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply
physical sense- the term gas here used.
