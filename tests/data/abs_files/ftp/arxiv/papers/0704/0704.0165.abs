  Let g be a finite dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra, and let V be a
finite dimensional represenation of g. We give a closed formula for the mth
Frobenius-Schur indicator, m>1, of V in representation-theoretic terms. We
deduce that the indicators take integer values, and that for a large enough m,
the mth indicator of V equals the dimension of the zero weight space of V. For
the classical Lie algebras sl(n), so(2n), so(2n+1) and sp(2n), this is the case
for m greater or equal to 2n-1, 4n-5, 4n-3 and 2n+1, respectively.
