  In this note we describe the natural coordinatizations of a Delzant space
defined as a reduced phase space (symplectic geometry view-point) and give
explicit formulas for the coordinate transformations. For each fixed point of
the torus action on the Delzant polytope, we have a maximal coordinatization of
an open cell in the Delzant space which contains the fixed point. This cell is
equal to the domain of definition of one of the natural coordinatizations of
the Delzant space as a toric variety (complex algebraic geometry view-point),
and we give an explicit formula for the toric variety coordinates in terms of
the reduced phase space coordinates. We use considerations in the maximal
coordinate neighborhoods to give simple proofs of some of the basic facts about
the Delzant space, as a reduced phase space, and as a toric variety. These can
be viewed as a first application of the coordinatizations, and serve to make
the presentation more self-contained.
