  A new incremental algorithm for data compression is presented. For a sequence
of input symbols algorithm incrementally constructs a p-adic integer number as
an output. Decoding process starts with less significant part of a p-adic
integer and incrementally reconstructs a sequence of input symbols. Algorithm
is based on certain features of p-adic numbers and p-adic norm. p-adic coding
algorithm may be considered as of generalization a popular compression
technique - arithmetic coding algorithms. It is shown that for p = 2 the
algorithm works as integer variant of arithmetic coding; for a special class of
models it gives exactly the same codes as Huffman's algorithm, for another
special model and a specific alphabet it gives Golomb-Rice codes.
