  We search for galaxy counterparts to damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) at
z>2 towards nine quasars, which have 14 DLAs and 8 sub-DLAs in their spectra.
We use integral field spectroscopy to search for Ly-alpha emission line objects
at the redshifts of the absorption systems. Besides recovering two previously
confirmed objects, we find six statistically significant candidate Ly-alpha
emission line objects. The candidates are identified as having wavelengths
close to the DLA line where the background quasar emission is absorbed. In
comparison with the six currently known Ly-alpha emitting DLA galaxies the
candidates have similar line fluxes and line widths, while velocity offsets
between the emission lines and systemic DLA redshifts are larger. The impact
parameters are larger than 10 kpc, and lower column density systems are found
at larger impact parameters. Assuming that a single gas cloud extends from the
QSO line of sight to the location of the candidate emission line, we find that
the average candidate DLA galaxy is surrounded by neutral gas with an
exponential scale length of ~5 kpc.
