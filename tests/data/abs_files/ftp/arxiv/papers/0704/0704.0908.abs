  We detect a dip of 20-45% in the surface brightness and number counts of NVSS
sources smoothed to a few degrees at the location of the WMAP cold spot. The
dip has structure on scales of approximately 1-10 degrees. Together with
independent all-sky wavelet analyses, our results suggest that the dip in
extragalactic brightness and number counts and the WMAP cold spot are
physically related, i.e., that the coincidence is neither a statistical anomaly
nor a WMAP foreground correction problem. If the cold spot does originate from
structures at modest redshifts, as we suggest, then there is no remaining need
for non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB to explain
the cold spot. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen
statistically for NVSS source counts, can now be seen to operate on a single
region. To create the magnitude and angular size of the WMAP cold spot requires
a ~140 Mpc radius completely empty void at z<=1 along this line of sight. This
is far outside the current expectations of the concordance cosmology, and adds
to the anomalies seen in the CMB.
