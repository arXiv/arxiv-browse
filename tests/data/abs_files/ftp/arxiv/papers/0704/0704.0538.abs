  We investigated structure and morphology of PTFE layers deposited by vacuum
process in dependence on deposition parameters: deposition rate, deposition
temperature, electron activation energy and activation current. Pentacene (PnC)
layers deposited on top of those PTFE films are used as a tool to demonstrate
the orienting ability of the PTFE layers. The molecular structure of the PTFE
films was investigated by use of infrared spectroscopy. By means of
ellipsometry, values of refractive index between 1.33 and 1.36 have been
obtained for PTFE films in dependence on deposition conditions. Using the cold
friction technique orienting PTFE layers with unidirectional grooves are
obtained. On top of these PTFE films oriented PnC layers were grown. The
obtained order depends both on the PTFE layer thickness and on PnC growth
temperature.
