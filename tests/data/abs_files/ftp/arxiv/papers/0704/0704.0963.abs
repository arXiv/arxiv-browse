Title: Nova Geminorum 1912 and the Origin of the Idea of Gravitational Lensing

  Einstein's early calculations of gravitational lensing, contained in a
scratch notebook and dated to the spring of 1912, are reexamined. A hitherto
unknown letter by Einstein suggests that he entertained the idea of explaining
the phenomenon of new stars by gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 much
more seriously than was previously assumed. A reexamination of the relevant
calculations by Einstein shows that, indeed, at least some of them most likely
date from early October 1915. But in support of earlier historical
interpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of Nova
Geminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant context
and motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his first
meeting with Erwin Freundlich during a visit in Berlin in April 1912. We also
comment on the significance of Einstein's consideration of gravitational
lensing in the fall of 1915 for the reconstruction of Einstein's final steps in
his path towards general relativity.
