  The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links
makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to
keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.
Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by
the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating
flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all
cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a
per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the
collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant
for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.
However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative
accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of
sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the
original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the
impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.
In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in
NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss
of monitoring detail.
