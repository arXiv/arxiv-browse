  The study of the innermost circumstellar layers around AGB stars is crucial
to understand how these envelopes are formed and evolve. The SiO maser emission
occurs at a few stellar radii from the central star, providing direct
information on the stellar pulsation and on the chemical and physical
properties of these regions. Our data also shed light on several aspects of the
SiO maser pumping theory that are not well understood yet. We aim to determine}
the relative spatial distribution of the 43 GHz and 86 GHz SiO maser lines in
the oxygen-rich evolved star R Leo. We have imaged with milliarcsecond
resolution, by means of Very Long Baseline Interferometry, the 43 GHz (28SiO
v=1, 2 J=1-0 and 29SiO v=0 J=1-0) and 86 GHz (28SiO v=1 J=2-1 and 29SiO v=0
J=2-1) masing regions. We confirm previous results obtained in other
oxygen-rich envelopes. In particular, when comparing the 43 GHz emitting
regions, the 28SiO v=2 transition is produced in an inner layer, closer to the
central star. On the other hand, the 86 GHz line arises in a clearly farther
shell. We have also mapped for the first time the 29SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission in R
Leo. The already reported discrepancy between the observed distributions of the
different maser lines and the theoretical predictions is also found in R Leo.
