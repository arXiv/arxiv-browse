  Future detection/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMB
observations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory.
Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r <
0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present all
known string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level
of detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may
present a challenge to string cosmology.
  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation
that in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the
Hubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For
the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an
extremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r
> 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are
superheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications for
particle phenomenology based on string theory.
