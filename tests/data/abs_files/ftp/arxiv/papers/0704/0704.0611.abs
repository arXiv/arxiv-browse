  Efficient control of a laser welding process requires the reliable prediction
of process behavior. A statistical method of field modeling, based on
normalized RBFNN, can be successfully used to predict the spatiotemporal
dynamics of surface optical activity in the laser welding process. In this
article we demonstrate how to optimize RBFNN to maximize prediction quality.
Special attention is paid to the structure of sample vectors, which represent
the bridge between the field distributions in the past and future.
