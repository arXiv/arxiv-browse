  The thermal decomposition of norbornane (dissolved in benzene) has been
studied in a jet stirred reactor at temperatures between 873 and 973 K, at
residence times ranging from 1 to 4 s and at atmospheric pressure, leading to
conversions from 0.04 to 22.6%. 25 reaction products were identified and
quantified by gas chromatography, amongst which the main ones are hydrogen,
ethylene and 1,3-cyclopentadiene. A mechanism investigation of the thermal
decomposition of the norbornane - benzene binary mixture has been performed.
Reactions involved in the mechanism have been reviewed: unimolecular
initiations 1 by C-C bond scission of norbornane, fate of the generated
diradicals, reactions of transfer and propagation of norbornyl radicals,
reactions of benzene and cross-coupling reactions.
