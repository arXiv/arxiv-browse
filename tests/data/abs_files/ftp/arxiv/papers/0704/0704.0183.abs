  This paper examines the effect of temperature on the structural stability and
mechanical properties of 20 layered (10,10) single walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) under tensile loading using an O(N) tight binding molecular dynamics
(TBMD) simulation method. We observed that (10,10) tube can sustain its
structural stability for the strain values of 0.23 in elongation and 0.06 in
compression at 300K. Bond breaking strain value decreases with increasing
temperature under streching but not under compression. The elastic limit,
Young's modulus, tensile strength and Poisson ratio are calculated as 0.10,
0.395 TPa, 83.23 GPa, 0.285, respectively, at 300K. In the temperature range
from 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasing
with increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At higher
temperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio and
tensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, the
SWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed and
softened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of
300K to 900K.
