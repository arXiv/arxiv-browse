  The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like
nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer
set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet
is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information
dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between
individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location.
  In this paper, several of us involved in the development and evolution of the
Internet share our views of its origins and history. This is intended to be a
brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history. This history revolves around
four distinct aspects. There is the technological evolution that began with
early research on packet switching and the ARPANET (and related technologies),
and where current research continues to expand the horizons of the
infrastructure along several dimensions, such as scale, performance, and higher
level functionality. There is the operations and management aspect of a global
and complex operational infrastructure. There is the social aspect, which
resulted in a broad community of Internauts working together to create and
evolve the technology. And there is the commercialization aspect, resulting in
an extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed
and available information infrastructure.
