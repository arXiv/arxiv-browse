Title: An axiomatic approach to default risk and model uncertainty in rating
  systems

  In this paper, we deal with an axiomatic approach to default risk. We
introduce the notion of a default risk measure, which generalizes the classical
probability of default (PD), and allows to incorporate model risk in various
forms. We discuss different properties and representations of default risk
measures via monetary risk measures, families of related tail risk measures,
and Choquet capacities. In a second step, we turn our focus on default risk
measures, which are given as worst-case PDs and distorted PDs. The latter are
frequently used in order to take into account model risk for the computation of
capital requirements through risk-weighted assets (RWAs), as demanded by the
Capital Requirement Regulation (CRR). In this context, we discuss the impact of
different default risk measures and margins of conservatism on the amount of
risk-weighted assets.

Title: Deep Calibration With Artificial Neural Network: A Performance
  Comparison on Option Pricing Models
Authors: Young Shin Kim, Hyangju Kim, Jaehyung Choi
Categories: q-fin.MF cs.CE cs.LG
Comments: 26 pages, 3 figures

  This paper explores Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as a model-free solution
for a calibration algorithm of option pricing models. We construct ANNs to
calibrate parameters for two well-known GARCH-type option pricing models:
Duan's GARCH and the classical tempered stable GARCH that significantly improve
upon the limitation of the Black-Scholes model but have suffered from
computation complexity. To mitigate this technical difficulty, we train ANNs
with a dataset generated by Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method and apply them
to calibrate optimal parameters. The performance results indicate that the ANN
approach consistently outperforms MCS and takes advantage of faster computation
times once trained. The Greeks of options are also discussed.

Title: Classification and calibration of affine models driven by independent
  L\'evy processes
Authors: Micha{\l} Barski, Rafa{\l} {\L}ochowski
Categories: math.PR q-fin.MF
Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2204.07245
\\
  The paper is devoted to the study of the short rate equation of the form $$
dR(t)=F(R(t))dt+\sum_{i=1}^{d}G_i(R(t-))dZ_i(t), \quad R(0)=x\geq 0, \quad t>0,
$$ with deterministic functions $F,G_1,...,G_d$ and independent L\'evy
processes of infinite variation $Z_1,...,Z_d$ with regularly varying Laplace
exponents. The equation is supposed to have a nonnegative solution which
generates an affine term structure model. A precise form of the generator of
$R$ is characterized and a related classification of equations which generate
affine models introduced in the spirit of Dai and Singleton
\cite{DaiSingleton}. Each class is shown to have its own canonical
representation which is an equation with the same drift and the jump diffusion
part based on a L\'evy process taking values in $\mathbb{R}^{g}, 1\leq g\leq
d$, with independent coordinates being stable processes with stability indices
in the range $(1,2]$. Numerical calibration results of canonical
representations to the market term structure of interest rates are presented
and compared with the classical CIR model. The paper generalizes the classical
results on the CIR model from \cite{CIR}, as well as on its extended version
from \cite{BarskiZabczykCIR} and \cite{BarskiZabczyk} where $Z$ was a
one-dimensional L\'evy process.
