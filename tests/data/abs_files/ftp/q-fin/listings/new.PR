Title: NFT Bubbles
Authors: Andrea Barbon and Angelo Ranaldo
Categories: q-fin.PR q-fin.TR
\\
  By investigating nonfungible tokens (NFTs), we provide the first systematic
study of retail investor behavior through asset bubbles. Given that NFTs are
recorded in public blockchains, we are able to track investor behavior over
time, leading to the identification of numerous price run-ups and crashes. Our
study reveals that agent-level variables, such as investor sophistication,
heterogeneity, and wash trading, in addition to aggregate variables, such as
volatility, price acceleration, and turnover, significantly predict bubble
formation and price crashes. We find that sophisticated investors consistently
outperform others and exhibit characteristics consistent with superior
information and skills, supporting the narrative surrounding asset pricing
bubbles.

Title: The Financial Market of Indices of Socioeconomic Wellbeing

  The financial industry should be involved in mitigating the risk of downturns
in the financial wellbeing indices around the world by implementing
well-developed financial tools such as insurance instruments on the underlying
wellbeing indices. We define a new quantitative measure of the wellbeing of a
country's population for those countries using the world development indicators
provided by the World Bank. We monetize the indices of socioeconomic wellbeing,
which serve as "risky assets," and consequently develop a global financial
market for them, which serves as a "market of indices of socioeconomic
wellbeing." Then, we compare the wellbeing of different countries using
financial econometric analysis and dynamic asset pricing theory. We provide the
optimal portfolio weight composition along with the efficient frontiers of the
wellbeing socioeconomic indices with different risk-return measures. We derive
insurance instruments, such as put options, which allow the financial industry
to monitor, manage, and trade these indices, creating the funds for insurance
against adverse movements of those indices. Our findings should help financial
institutions to incorporate socioeconomic issues as an additional dimension to
their "two-dimensional" risk-return adjusted optimal financial portfolios.
