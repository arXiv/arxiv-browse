Title: A Bayesian derivation of the square root law of market impact
Authors: Louis Saddier and Matteo Marsili
Categories: q-fin.TR cond-mat.stat-mech
Comments: 16 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We show that the main empirical findings on the impact of a sequence of
transactions on prices of financial assets can be recovered within a
surprisingly simple model with fully Bayesian market expectations. This
includes {\em i)} the square-root behavior of the expected price variation with
the total volume traded, {\em ii)} it's crossover to a linear regime for small
volumes, and {\em iii)} the impact decay back to equilibrium, after the
sequence of trades is over. The simplicity of this derivation lends further
support to its robustness and universality, and it sheds light on its origin.
In particular, it suggests that the square-root impact law originates from the
over-estimation of order flows originating from meta-orders.

Title: A parsimonious neural network approach to solve portfolio optimization
  problems without using dynamic programming
Authors: Pieter M. van Staden and Peter A. Forsyth and Yuying Li
Categories: q-fin.CP
\\
  We present a parsimonious neural network approach, which does not rely on
dynamic programming techniques, to solve dynamic portfolio optimization
problems subject to multiple investment constraints. The number of parameters
of the (potentially deep) neural network remains independent of the number of
portfolio rebalancing events, and in contrast to, for example, reinforcement
learning, the approach avoids the computation of high-dimensional conditional
expectations. As a result, the approach remains practical even when considering
large numbers of underlying assets, long investment time horizons or very
frequent rebalancing events. We prove convergence of the numerical solution to
the theoretical optimal solution of a large class of problems under fairly
general conditions, and present ground truth analyses for a number of popular
formulations, including mean-variance and mean-conditional value-at-risk
problems. We also show that it is feasible to solve Sortino ratio-inspired
objectives (penalizing only the variance of wealth outcomes below the mean) in
dynamic trading settings with the proposed approach. Using numerical
experiments, we demonstrate that if the investment objective functional is
separable in the sense of dynamic programming, the correct time-consistent
optimal investment strategy is recovered, otherwise we obtain the correct
pre-commitment (time-inconsistent) investment strategy. The proposed approach
remains agnostic as to the underlying data generating assumptions, and results
are illustrated using (i) parametric models for underlying asset returns, (ii)
stationary block bootstrap resampling of empirical returns, and (iii)
generative adversarial network (GAN)-generated synthetic asset returns.

Title: Economics of In-Space Industry and Competitiveness of Lunar-Derived
  Rocket Propellant
Authors: Philip Metzger
Categories: econ.GN physics.soc-ph q-fin.EC
Comments: To be published in Acta Astronautica. 50 pages, 16 figures
\\
  Economic parameters are identified for an in-space industry where the capital
is made on one planet, it is transported to and teleoperated on a second
planet, and the product is transported off the second planet for consumption.
This framework is used to model the long-run cost of lunar propellant
production to help answer whether it is commercially competitive against
propellant launched from Earth. The prior techno-economic analyses (TEAs) of
lunar propellant production had disagreed over this. The "gear ratio on cost"
for capital transport, G, and the production mass ratio of the capital, phi,
are identified as the most important factors determining competitiveness. The
prior TEAs are examined for how they handled these two metrics. This identifies
crucial mistakes in some of the TEAs: choosing transportation architectures
with high G, and neglecting to make choices for the capital that could achieve
adequate phi. The tent sublimation technology has a value of phi that is an
order of magnitude better than the threshold for competitiveness even in low
Earth orbit (LEO). The strip mining technology is closer to the threshold, but
technological improvements plus several years of operating experience will
improve its competitiveness, according to the model. Objections from members of
the aerospace community are discussed, especially the question whether the
technology can attain adequate reliability in the lunar environment. The
results suggest that lunar propellant production will be commercially viable
and that it should lower the cost of doing everything else in space.

Title: Economic Consequences of Online Tracking Restrictions
Authors: Klaus M. Miller and Bernd Skiera
Categories: econ.GN q-fin.EC
\\
  In recent years, European regulators have debated restricting the time an
online tracker can track a user to protect consumer privacy better. Despite the
significance of these debates, there has been a noticeable absence of any
comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. This article fills this gap on the cost
side by suggesting an approach to estimate the economic consequences of
lifetime restrictions on cookies for publishers. The empirical study on cookies
of 54,127 users who received 128 million ad impressions over 2.5 years yields
an average cookie lifetime of 279 days, with an average value of EUR 2.52 per
cookie. Only 13% of all cookies increase their daily value over time, but their
average value is about four times larger than the average value of all cookies.
Restricting cookies lifetime to one year (two years) decreases their lifetime
value by 25% (19%), which represents a decrease in the value of all cookies of
9% (5%). In light of the EUR 10.60 billion cookie-based display ad revenue in
Europe, such restrictions would endanger EUR 904 million (EUR 576 million)
annually, equivalent to EUR 2.08 (EUR 1.33) per EU internet user. The article
discusses these results' marketing strategy challenges and opportunities for
advertisers and publishers.

Title: Real Options Technique as a Tool of Strategic Risk Management
Authors: Volodymyr Savchuk
Categories: q-fin.RM q-fin.ST
Comments: 22 pages, 11 figures, 12 tables
\\
  The real options approach is now considered an effective alternative to the
corporate DCF model for a feasibility study. The current paper offers a
practical methodology employing binomial trees and real options techniques for
evaluating investment projects. A general computation procedure is suggested
for the decision tree with two active stages of real options, which correspond
to additional investments. The suggested technique can be used for most real
options, which are practically essential regarding enterprise strategy. The
special case named Binomial-Random-Cash-Flow Real Options Model with random
outcomes is developed as the next step of real options modelling. Project Value
at Risk is introduced and used as a criterion of investment project feasibility
under the assumption regarding random outcomes. In particular, the Gaussian
probability distribution is used for modelling option outcomes uncertainty. The
choice of the Gaussian distribution is caused by the desire to obtain estimates
in the final analytical form. Choosing another distribution for random outcomes
leads to using Monte Carlo simulation, for which a general framework is
developed by demonstrating some instances. The author could avoid the
computational complexity that makes these solutions feasible for business
practice.

Title: Stock Trend Prediction: A Semantic Segmentation Approach
Authors: Shima Nabiee, Nader Bagherzadeh
Categories: q-fin.ST cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Market financial forecasting is a trending area in deep learning. Deep
learning models are capable of tackling the classic challenges in stock market
data, such as its extremely complicated dynamics as well as long-term temporal
correlation. To capture the temporal relationship among these time series,
recurrent neural networks are employed. However, it is difficult for recurrent
models to learn to keep track of long-term information. Convolutional Neural
Networks have been utilized to better capture the dynamics and extract features
for both short- and long-term forecasting. However, semantic segmentation and
its well-designed fully convolutional networks have never been studied for
time-series dense classification. We present a novel approach to predict
long-term daily stock price change trends with fully 2D-convolutional
encoder-decoders. We generate input frames with daily prices for a time-frame
of T days. The aim is to predict future trends by pixel-wise classification of
the current price frame. We propose a hierarchical CNN structure to encode
multiple price frames to multiscale latent representation in parallel using
Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling blocks and take that temporal coarse feature
stacks into account in the decoding stages. Our hierarchical structure of CNNs
makes it capable of capturing both long and short-term temporal relationships
effectively. The effect of increasing the input time horizon via incrementing
parallel encoders has been studied with interesting and substantial changes in
the output segmentation masks. We achieve overall accuracy and AUC of %78.18
and 0.88 for joint trend prediction over the next 20 days, surpassing other
semantic segmentation approaches. We compared our proposed model with several
deep models specifically designed for technical analysis and found that for
different output horizons, our proposed models outperformed other models.

Title: Portfolio Volatility Estimation Relative to Stock Market Cross-Sectional
  Intrinsic Entropy
Authors: Claudiu Vinte, Marcel Ausloos
Categories: q-fin.ST
Comments: 24 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables
Journal-ref: Journal of Risk Financial Management 2023, 16(2), 114
DOI: 10.3390/jrfm16020114
\\
  Selecting stock portfolios and assessing their relative volatility risk
compared to the market as a whole, market indices, or other portfolios is of
great importance to professional fund managers and individual investors alike.
Our research uses the cross-sectional intrinsic entropy (CSIE) model to
estimate the cross-sectional volatility of the stock groups that can be
considered together as portfolio constituents. In our study, we benchmark
portfolio volatility risks against the volatility of the entire market provided
by the CSIE and the volatility of market indices computed using longitudinal
data. This article introduces CSIE-based betas to characterise the relative
volatility risk of the portfolio against market indices and the market as a
whole. We empirically prove that, through CSIE-based betas, multiple sets of
symbols that outperform the market indices in terms of rate of return while
maintaining the same level of risk or even lower than the one exhibited by the
market index can be discovered, for any given time interval. These sets of
symbols can be used as constituent stock portfolios and, in connection with the
perspective provided by the CSIE volatility estimates, to hierarchically assess
their relative volatility risk within the broader context of the overall
volatility of the stock market.

Title: A Deep Dive into NFT Whales: A Longitudinal Study of the NFT Trading
  Ecosystem
Authors: Na Hyeon Park, Hanna Kim, Chanhee Lee, Changhoon Yoon, Seunghyeon Lee,

Categories: q-fin.ST
\\
  NFT (Non-fungible Token) has drastically increased in its size, accounting
for over \$16.9B of total market capitalization. Despite the rapid growth of
NFTs, this market has not been examined thoroughly from a financial
perspective. In this paper, we conduct methodical analyses to identify NFT
market movers who play a significant role in potentially manipulating and
oscillating NFT values. We collect over 3.8M NFT transaction data from the
Ethereum Blockchain from January 2021 to February 2022 to extract trading
information in line with the NFT lifecycle: (i) mint, (ii) transfer/sale, and
(iii) burn. Based on the size of held NFT values, we classify NFT traders into
three groups (whales, dolphins, and minnows). In total, we analyze 430K traders
from 91 different NFT collection sources. We find that the top 0.1\% of NFT
traders (i.e., whales) drive the NFT market with consistent, high returns. We
then identify and characterize the NFT whales' unique investment strategies
(e.g., mint/sale patterns, wash trading) to empirically understand the whales
in the NFT market for the first time.

Title: Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Authors: Haritha GB and Sahana N.B

\\
  The cryptocurrency ecosystem has been the centre of discussion on many social
media platforms, following its noted volatility and varied opinions. Twitter is
rapidly being utilised as a news source and a medium for bitcoin discussion.
Our algorithm seeks to use historical prices and sentiment of tweets to
forecast the price of Bitcoin. In this study, we develop an end-to-end model
that can forecast the sentiment of a set of tweets (using a Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers - based Neural Network Model) and
forecast the price of Bitcoin (using Gated Recurrent Unit) using the predicted
sentiment and other metrics like historical cryptocurrency price data, tweet
volume, a user's following, and whether or not a user is verified. The
sentiment prediction gave a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 9.45%, an average
of real-time data, and test data. The mean absolute percent error for the price
prediction was 3.6%.

Title: Main Concepts and Principles of Political Economy -- Production and
  Values, Distribution and Prices, Reproduction and Profits
Authors: Christian Flamant
Categories: econ.GN q-fin.EC
\\
  This book starts from the basic questions that had been raised by the
founders of Economic theory, Smith, Ricardo, and Marx: what makes the value of
commodities, what are production, exchange, money and incomes like profits,
wages and rents. The answers that these economists had provided were mostly
wrong, above all by defining the equivalence of commodities at the level of
exchange, but also because of a confusion made between values and prices, and
wrong views of what production really is and the role of fixed capital. Using
the mathematical theory of measurement and the physical theory of dimensional
analysis, this book provides a coherent theory of value based on an equivalence
relation not at the level of exchange, but of production. Indeed exchange is
considered here as an equivalence relation between money and a monetary price,
and not between commodities, modern monetary theory having demonstrated that
money is not a commodity. The book rejects the conception of production as a
surplus, which owes much to Sraffa's theory of production prices, and is shown
to be severely flawed. It founds the equivalence of commodities at the level of
a production process considered as a transformation process. It rehabilitates
the labor theory of value, based on the connection between money and labor due
the monetary payment of wages, which allows the homogenization of various kinds
of concrete labor into abstract labor. It shows that value is then a dimension
of commodities and that this dimension is time, i.e. the time of physics. On
this background, the book shows that the calculation of values for all
commodities is always possible, even in the case of joint production, and that
there cannot be any commodity residue left by this calculation. As a further
step, this book provides a coherent theory of the realization of the product,
which occurs in the circulation process. Using an idea - the widow's cruse -
introduced by Keynes in his Treatise on Money, it brings to light the mechanism
behind the transformation of money values into money prices and of
surplus-value into profits and other transfer incomes, ensuring the formation
of monetary profits. The book sheds some light on the rate of profit, its
determinants and its evolution, showing in particular the paramount importance
of capitalist consumption as one of its main determinants. In passing it
explains the reasons why in the real world there is a multiplicity of profit
rates. Finally, it allows to solve in a precise and illustrated way the
problems raised by the Marxist law of the tendency of the rate of profit to
fall. Most of the results obtained translate into principles, the first ones
being truly basic, the following ones less basic, but all of them being
fundamental. All in all, this book might provide the first building blocks to
develop a full-fledged and scientific economic theory to many fellow
economists, critical of neo-classical theory, but who have not yet dicovered
the bases of a complete and coherent alternative.

Title: Simplifying and Improving: Revisiting Bulgaria's Revenue Forecasting
  Models
Authors: Fabio Ashtar Telarico
Categories: econ.GN q-fin.EC stat.AP
Journal-ref: Economic Thought, 2023, 20 (6)
DOI: 10.56497/etj2367601
\\
  In the thirty years since the end of real socialism, Bulgaria's went from
having a rather radically 'different' tax system to adopting flat-rate taxation
with marginal tax rates that fell from figures as high as 40% to 10% for both
the corporate-income tax and the personal-income tax. Crucially, the
econometric forecasting models in use at the Bulgarian Ministry of Finance
hinted at an increase in tax revenue compatible with the so-called 'Laffer
curve'. Similarly, many economists held the view that revenues would have
increased. However, reality fell short of those expectations based on
forecasting models and rooted in mainstream economic theory. Thus, this paper
asks whether there are betterperforming forecasting models for personal-and
corporate-income tax-revenues in Bulgaria that are readily implementable and
overperform the ones currently in use. After articulating a constructive
critique of the current forecasting models, the paper offers readily
implementable, transparent alternatives and proves their superiority.

Title: Stock Price Prediction Using Temporal Graph Model with Value Chain Data
Authors: Chang Liu and Sandra Paterlini
Categories: q-fin.ST cs.LG q-fin.CP
\\
  Stock price prediction is a crucial element in financial trading as it allows
traders to make informed decisions about buying, selling, and holding stocks.
Accurate predictions of future stock prices can help traders optimize their
trading strategies and maximize their profits. In this paper, we introduce a
neural network-based stock return prediction method, the Long Short-Term Memory
Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LSTM-GCN) model, which combines the Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Cells.
Specifically, the GCN is used to capture complex topological structures and
spatial dependence from value chain data, while the LSTM captures temporal
dependence and dynamic changes in stock returns data. We evaluated the LSTM-GCN
model on two datasets consisting of constituents of Eurostoxx 600 and S&P 500.
Our experiments demonstrate that the LSTM-GCN model can capture additional
information from value chain data that are not fully reflected in price data,
and the predictions outperform baseline models on both datasets.

Title: Improving CNN-base Stock Trading By Considering Data Heterogeneity and
  Burst
Authors: Keer Yang, Guanqun Zhang, Chuan Bi, Qiang Guan, Hailu Xu, Shuai Xu

DOI: 10.5121/ijci.2023.120201
\\
  In recent years, there have been quite a few attempts to apply intelligent
techniques to financial trading, i.e., constructing automatic and intelligent
trading framework based on historical stock price. Due to the unpredictable,
uncertainty and volatile nature of financial market, researchers have also
resorted to deep learning to construct the intelligent trading framework. In
this paper, we propose to use CNN as the core functionality of such framework,
because it is able to learn the spatial dependency (i.e., between rows and
columns) of the input data. However, different with existing deep
learning-based trading frameworks, we develop novel normalization process to
prepare the stock data. In particular, we first empirically observe that the
stock data is intrinsically heterogeneous and bursty, and then validate the
heterogeneity and burst nature of stock data from a statistical perspective.
Next, we design the data normalization method in a way such that the data
heterogeneity is preserved and bursty events are suppressed. We verify out
developed CNN-based trading framework plus our new normalization method on 29
stocks. Experiment results show that our approach can outperform other
comparing approaches.
