Title: DeFi Lending During The Merge
Authors: Lioba Heimbach, Eric Schertenleib, Roger Wattenhofer
Categories: q-fin.GN
\\
  Lending protocols in decentralized finance enable the permissionless exchange
of capital from lenders to borrowers without relying on a trusted third party
for clearing or market-making. Interest rates are purely set by the supply and
demand of capital according to a pre-defined function. In the lead-up to The
Merge: Ethereum blockchain's transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to
proof-of-stake (PoS), a fraction of the Ethereum ecosystem announced plans of
continuing with a PoW-chain. Owners of ETH - whether their ETH was borrowed or
not - would hold the native tokens on each chain. This development alarmed
lending protocols. They feared spiking ETH borrowing rates would lead to mass
liquidations which could undermine their viability. Thus, the decentralized
autonomous organization running the protocols saw no alternative to
intervention - restricting users' ability to borrow.
  We investigate the effects of the merge and the intervention on the two
biggest lending protocols on Ethereum: AAVE and Compound. Our analysis finds
that borrowing rates were extremely volatile, jumping by two orders of
magnitude, and borrowing at times reached 100% of the available funds. Despite
this, no spike in mass liquidations or irretrievable loans materialized.
Further, we are the first to quantify and analyze hard-fork-arbitrage,
profiting from holding debt in the native blockchain token during a hard fork.
We find that arbitrageurs made 13 Mio US$, money that was effectively extracted
from the platforms' lenders.
  Finally, we identify alarming security risks to the entire Ethereum
ecosystem. Around one-fifth of the staked ETH through LIDO (stETH) was locked
as collateral on lending protocols. Mass liquidations caused by spiking rates
would have devastating effects on the stETH price and pose security concerns
for the consensus layer, as staking power could be bought at a significant
discount.
