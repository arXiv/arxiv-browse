  We consider adsorption of random copolymer chains onto an interface within
the model of Garel et al. Europhysics Letters 8, 9 (1989). By using the replica
method the adsorption of the copolymer at the interface is mapped onto the
problem of finding the ground state of a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian. To
study this ground state we introduce a novel variational principle for the
Green's function, which generalizes the well-known Rayleigh-Ritz method of
Quantum Mechanics to nonstationary states. Minimization with an appropriate
trial Green's function enables us to find the phase diagram for the
localization-delocalization transition for an ideal random copolymer at the
interface.
