  An expression for the joint probability distribution of the principal
curvatures at an arbitrary point in the ensemble of isosurfaces defined on
isotropic Gaussian random fields on Rn is derived. The result is obtained by
deriving symmetry properties of the ensemble of second derivative matrices of
isotropic Gaussian random fields akin to those of the Gaussian orthogonal
ensemble.
