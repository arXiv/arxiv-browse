  We find pairs of solutions to a differential equation which is obtained as a
special limit of a generalized spheroidal wave equation (this is also known as
confluent Heun equation). One solution in each pair is given by a series of
hypergeometric functions and converges for any finite value of the independent
variable $z$, while the other is given by a series of modified Bessel functions
and converges for $|z|>|z_{0}|$, where $z_{0}$ denotes a regular singularity.
For short, the preceding limit is called Ince's limit after Ince who have used
the same procedure to get the Mathieu equations from the Whittaker-Hill ones.
We find as well that, when $z_{0}$ tends to zero, the Ince limit of the
generalized spheroidal wave equation turns out to be the Ince limit of a
double-confluent Heun equation, for which solutions are provided. Finally, we
show that the Schr\"odinger equation for inverse fourth and sixth-power
potentials reduces to peculiar cases of the double-confluent Heun equation and
its Ince's limit, respectively.
