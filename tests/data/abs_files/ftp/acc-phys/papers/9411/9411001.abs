  A recently developed method for the calculation of Lyapunov exponents of
dynamical systems is described. The method is applicable whenever the
linearized dynamics is Hamiltonian. By utilizing the exponential representation
of symplectic matrices, this approach avoids the renormalization and
reorthogonalization procedures necessary in usual techniques. It is also easily
extendible to damped systems. The method is illustrated by considering two
examples of physical interest: a model system that describes the beam halo in
charged particle beams and the driven van der Pol oscillator.
