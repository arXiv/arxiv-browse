Title: A Model-Independent Determination of Red Noise in Pulsar Timing Arrivals
Authors: Reinabelle Reyes and Christopher C. Bernido
Categories: astro-ph.IM stat.ME
Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to Frontiers in Astronomy and Space
  Sciences
\\
  Noise is ubiquitous in pulsar signals where red noise has been attributed to
effects arising from the interstellar medium, spin noise, and pulsar mode
changes, among others. The red noise, however, has not been detected in all
pulsars. Using the dataset from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for
Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), we investigate twenty-three pulsars and show
that an evaluation of the mean square deviation and probability distribution of
timing residuals can provide a straightforward way of determining the presence
of red noise. The results agree with those reported in the literature. The
model-free method presented could complement the normally more sophisticated
model-dependent way of determining red noise in timing residuals.

  Electromagnetic interference (EMI) for low-temperature detectors is a serious
concern in many missions. We investigate the EMI caused by the spacecraft
components to the x-ray microcalorimeter of the Resolve instrument onboard the
X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), which is currently under
development by an international collaboration and is planned to be launched in
2023. We focus on the EMI from (a) the low-frequency magnetic field generated
by the magnetic torquers (MTQ) used for the spacecraft attitude control and (b)
the radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic field generated by the S and X band
antennas used for communication between the spacecraft and the ground stations.
We executed a series of ground tests both at the instrument and spacecraft
levels using the flight-model hardware in 2021-2022 in a JAXA facility in
Tsukuba. We also conducted electromagnetic simulations partially using the
Fugaku high-performance computing facility. The MTQs were found to couple with
the microcalorimeter, which we speculate through pick-ups of low-frequency
magnetic field and further capacitive coupling. There is no evidence that the
resultant energy resolution degradation is beyond the current allocation of
noise budget. The RF communication system was found to leave no significant
effect. We present the result of the tests and simulation in this article.

  Low-temperature detectors often use mechanical coolers as part of the cooling
chain in order to reach sub-Kelvin operating temperatures. The microphonics
noise caused by the mechanical coolers is a general and inherent issue for
these detectors. We have observed this effect in the ground test data obtained
with the Resolve instrument to be flown on the XRISM satellite. Resolve is a
cryogenic X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer with a required energy resolution
of 7 eV at 6 keV. Five mechanical coolers are used to cool from ambient
temperature to about 4 K: four two-stage Stirling coolers (STC) driven
nominally at 15 Hz and a Joule-Thomson cooler (JTC) driven nominally at 52 Hz.
In 2019, we operated the flight-model instrument for two weeks, in which we
also obtained accelerometer data inside the cryostat at a low-temperature stage
(He tank). X-ray detector and accelerometer data were obtained continuously
while changing the JTC drive frequency, which produced a unique data set for
investigating how the vibration from the cryocoolers propagates to the
detector. In the detector noise spectra, we observed harmonics of both STCs and
JTC. More interestingly, we also observed the low (<20 Hz) frequency beat
between the 4'th JTC and 14'th STC harmonics and the 7'th JTC and the 23--24'th
STC harmonics. We present here a description and interpretation of these
measurements.

  Resolve is a payload hosting an X-ray microcalorimeter detector operated at
50 mK in the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). It is currently
under development as part of an international collaboration and is planned to
be launched in 2023. A primary technical concern is the micro-vibration
interference in the sensitive microcalorimeter detector caused by the
spacecraft bus components. We conducted a series of verification tests in
2021-2022 on the ground, the results of which are reported here. We defined the
micro-vibration interface between the spacecraft and the Resolve instrument. In
the instrument-level test, the flight-model hardware was tested against the
interface level by injecting it with micro-vibrations and evaluating the
instrument response using the 50 mK stage temperature stability, ADR magnet
current consumption rate, and detector noise spectra. We found strong responses
when injecting micro-vibration at about 200, 380, and 610 Hz. In the former two
cases, the beat between the injected frequency and cryocooler frequency
harmonics were observed in the detector noise spectra. In the spacecraft-level
test, the acceleration and instrument responses were measured with and without
suspension of the entire spacecraft. The reaction wheels (RWs) and inertial
reference units (IRUs), two major sources of micro-vibration among the bus
components, were operated. In conclusion, the observed responses of Resolve are
within the acceptable levels in the nominal operational range of the RWs and
IRUs. There is no evidence that the resultant energy
  resolution degradation is beyond the current allocation of noise budget.

Title: Improving the X-ray energy resolution of a scientific CMOS detector by
  pixel-level gain correction
Authors: Qinyu Wu, Zhixing Ling, Xinyang Wang, Chen Zhang, Weimin Yuan,

Categories: astro-ph.IM hep-ex physics.ins-det
Comments: accepted by PASP
\\
  Scientific Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (sCMOS) sensors are
finding increasingly more applications in astronomical observations, thanks to
their advantages over charge-coupled devices (CCDs) such as a higher readout
frame rate, higher radiation tolerance, and higher working temperature. In this
work, we investigate the performance at the individual pixel level of a
large-format sCMOS sensor, GSENSE1516BSI, which has 4096 * 4096 pixels, each of
15 {\mu}m in size. To achieve this, three areas on the sCMOS sensor, each
consisting of 99 * 99 pixels, are chosen for the experiment. The readout noise,
conversion gain and energy resolutions of the individual pixels in these areas
are measured from a large number (more than 25,000) of X-ray events accumulated
for each of the pixels through long time exposures. The energy resolution of
these pixels can reach 140 eV at 6.4 keV at room temperature and shows a
significant positive correlation with the readout noise. The accurate gain can
also be derived individually for each of the pixels from its X-ray spectrum
obtained. Variations of the gain values are found at a level of 0.56%
statistically among the 30 thousand pixels in the areas studied. With the gain
of each pixel determined accurately, a precise gain correction is performed
pixel by pixel in these areas, in contrast to the standardized ensemble gain
used in the conventional method. In this way, we could almost completely
eliminate the degradation of energy resolutions caused by gain variations among
pixels. As a result, the energy resolution at room temperature can be
significantly improved to 124.6 eV at 4.5 keV and 140.7 eV at 6.4 keV. This
pixel-by-pixel gain correction method can be applied to all kinds of CMOS
sensors, and is expected to find interesting applications in X-ray
spectroscopic observations in the future.

  In this work we present an application of the Goertzel Filter for the
channelization of multi-tonal signals, typically used for the read-out of
cryogenic sensors which are multiplexed in the frequency domain (FDM), by means
of Microwave Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) Multiplexer
($\mu$MUX). We demonstrate how implementing a bank of many of these filters,
can be used to perform a channelization of the multi-tonal input signal to
retrieve the data added by the sensors. We show how this approach can be
implemented in a resource-efficient manner in a Field Programmable Gate Array
(FPGA) within the state-of-the-art, which allows great scalability for reading
thousands of sensors; as is required by Radio Telescopes in Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation (CMB) surveys using cryogenic bolometers, particles
detection like Neutrino mass estimation using cryogenic calorimeters or Quantum
Computing.

Title: Roll Angle Adjustment Dims Starlink Satellites
Authors: Anthony Mallama and Jay Respler
Categories: astro-ph.IM
\\
  The brightness of Starlink satellites during orbit parking and orbit raising
decreased significantly in 2020 when the operator modified their orientation.
The mean apparent magnitude before the change was 3.90 +/- 0.18, while
afterward it was 5.69 +/- 0.06. When magnitudes are adjusted to a standard
distance of 1,000 km the means are 4.86 +/- 0.16 and 7.31 +/- 0.05. The
difference at the standard distance indicates that spacecraft with adjusted
roll angles are 90% fainter on average than the earlier ones.

  Galaxy-scale strong lenses in galaxy clusters provide a unique tool to
investigate their inner mass distribution and the sub-halo density profiles in
the low-mass regime, which can be compared with the predictions from
cosmological simulations. We search for galaxy-galaxy strong-lensing systems in
HST multi-band imaging of galaxy cluster cores from the CLASH and HFF programs
by exploring the classification capabilities of deep learning techniques.
Convolutional neural networks are trained utilising highly-realistic
simulations of galaxy-scale strong lenses injected into the HST cluster fields
around cluster members. To this aim, we take advantage of extensive
spectroscopic information on member galaxies in 16 clusters and the accurate
knowledge of the deflection fields in half of these from high-precision strong
lensing models. Using observationally-based distributions, we sample
magnitudes, redshifts and sizes of the background galaxy population. By placing
these sources within the secondary caustics associated with cluster galaxies,
we build a sample of ~3000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses which preserve the full
complexity of real multi-colour data and produce a wide diversity of strong
lensing configurations. We study two deep learning networks processing a large
sample of image cutouts in three HST/ACS bands, and we quantify their
classification performance using several standard metrics. We find that both
networks achieve a very good trade-off between purity and completeness
(85%-95%), as well as good stability with fluctuations within 2%-4%. We
characterise the limited number of false negatives and false positives in terms
of the physical properties of the background sources and cluster members. We
also demonstrate the neural networks' high degree of generalisation by applying
our method to HST observations of 12 clusters with previously known
galaxy-scale lensing systems.

Title: One EURO for Uranus: the Elliptical Uranian Relativity Orbiter mission
Authors: Lorenzo Iorio, Athul P. Girija, Daniele Durante

Comments: LaTex2e, 38 pages, 7 figures, no tables
\\
  Recent years have seen an increasing interest in sending a mission to Uranus,
visited so far only by Voyager 2 in 1986. EURO (Elliptical Uranian Relativity
Orbiter) is a preliminary mission concept investigating the possibility of
dynamically measuring the planet's angular momentum ${\boldsymbol S}$ by means
of the Lense-Thirring effect affecting a putative Uranian orbiter. It is
possible, at least in principle, to separate the relativistic precessions of
the orbital inclination $I$ to the Celestial Equator and of the longitude of
the ascending node $\Omega$ of the spacecraft from its classical rates of the
pericentre $\omega$ induced by the multipoles $J_\ell,\,\ell=2,\,3,\,4,\ldots$
of the planet's gravity field by adopting an orbital plane containing the
planet's spin axis $\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$, perpendicular to the Celestial
Equator, and whose position in the latter is the same as of the projection of
$\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$ on to it. For a wide and elliptical $2\,000\times
100\,000\,\mathrm{km}$ orbit, the gravitomagnetic signatures amount to tens of
milliarcseconds per year, while, for a suitable choice of the initial
conditions, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the range-rate shift can reach the
level of $\simeq 1.5\times 10^{-3}$ millimetre per second in a single
pericentre passage of a few hours. By lowering the apocentre height to
$10\,000\,\mathrm{km}$, the Lense-Thirring precessions are enhanced to the
level of hundreds of milliarcseconds per year. The uncertainties in the
orientation of $\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$ and in $I$ are major sources of
systematic bias; it turns out that they should be determined with accuracies as
good as $\simeq 0.1-1$ and $\simeq 1-10$ milliarcseconds, respectively.

  Obtaining high-resolution images at centimeter-or-longer wavelengths is vital
for understanding the physics of jets. We reconstructed images from the M87 22
GHz data observed with the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) by using the
regularized maximum likelihood (RML) method, which is different from the
conventional imaging method CLEAN. Consequently, a bright core and jet
extending about 30 mas to the northwest were detected with a higher resolution
than in the CLEAN image. The width of the jet was 0.5 mas at 0.3 mas from the
core, consistent with the width measured in the 86 GHz image in the previous
study. In addition, three ridges were able to be detected at around 8 mas from
the core, even though the peak-to-peak separation was only 1.0 mas. This
indicates that the RML image's spatial resolution is at least 30% higher than
that of the CLEAN image. This study is an important step for future
multi-frequency and high-cadence observations of the EAVN to discuss the more
detailed structure of the jet and its time variability.
