Title: Census of Gaseous Satellites around Local Spiral Galaxies
Authors: Jingyao Zhu and Mary E Putman
Categories: astro-ph.GA
Comments: 18 pages, 13 figures, accepted by MNRAS
\\
  We present a search for gas-containing dwarf galaxies as satellite systems
around nearby spiral galaxies using 21 cm neutral hydrogen (HI) data from the
Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) Survey. We have identified 15 spiral
`primary' galaxies in a local volume of 10 Mpc with a range of total masses,
and have found 19 gas-containing dwarf satellite candidates within the
primaries' virial volumes ($R_{200}$) and 46 candidates within $2R_{200}$. Our
sensitivity using ALFALFA data converts to $M_{\rm HI} \approx 7.4 \times
10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$ at 10 Mpc, which includes 13 of the 26 gaseous dwarf
galaxies in the Local Group, and the HI properties of our sample are overall
similar to these 13. We found $0-3$ gaseous satellites per host galaxy within
$R_{200}$ and $0-5$ within $2R_{200}$, which agrees with the low numbers
present for the Milky Way and M31. There is also agreement with the
star-forming satellite numbers per host in the deep optical surveys SAGA and
ELVES, and the Auriga cosmological simulations. When scaled to $R_{200}$, the
optical surveys do not show a trend of increasing quenched fraction with host
mass; there is a slight increase in the total number of gaseous satellites with
host mass for our sample. The low numbers of gaseous/star-forming satellites
around spiral hosts are consistent with the idea that a universal and effective
satellite quenching mechanism, such as ram pressure stripping by the host halo,
is likely at play.

  Massive black hole (BH) mergers will be key targets of future gravitational
wave and electromagnetic observational facilities. In order to constrain BH
evolution with the information extracted from BH mergers, one must take into
account the complex relationship between the population of merging BHs and the
global BH population. We analyse the high-resolution cosmological
radiation-hydrodynamics simulation Obelisk, run to redshift $z=3.5$, to study
the properties of the merging BH population, and its differences with the
underlying global BH population in terms of BH and galaxy properties. We
calculate in post-processing dynamical delays between the merger in the
simulation at the resolution limit and the actual coalescence well below the
resolution scale. We find that merging BHs are hosted in relatively massive
galaxies with stellar mass $M_\ast\gtrsim10^9\,M_\odot$. Given that galaxy mass
is correlated with other BH and galaxy properties, BH mergers tend to also have
higher total BH mass and higher BH accretion rates than the global population
of main BHs. These differences generally disappear if the merger population is
compared with a BH population sampled with the same galaxy mass distribution as
merger hosts. Galaxy mergers can temporarily boost the BH accretion rate and
the host's star formation rate, which can remain active at the BH merger if
sub-resolution delays are not taken into account. When dynamical delays are
taken into account the burst has generally faded by the time the BHs merge. BH
spins are followed self-consistently in the simulation, under the effect of
accretion and BH mergers. We find that merging BHs have higher spins than the
global population, but similar or somewhat lower spins compared to a
mass-matched sample. For our sample, mergers tend to decrease the spin of the
final BH remnant.

  We present ALMA CO(1-0) observations of the nearby LIRG galaxy pair
IRAS05054+1718 with a new analysis of X-ray data collected between 2012 and
2021 using NuSTAR, Swift, and XMM-Newton. The western component of the pair,
NED01, hosts a Seyfert 1.9 nucleus launching a powerful X-ray UFO. Our X-ray
spectral analysis suggests the UFO could be variable or multi-component in
velocity and constrains its momentum flux to $\dot p^{X-ray}_{out} \sim
(4\pm2)\times 10^{34}$ gcms$^{-2}$. ALMA CO(1-0) observations include also the
eastern component of the pair, a LIRG with no clear evidence for an AGN. We
study the CO(1-0) kinematics in the two galaxies using the 3D-BAROLO code. In
both sources, we can model the bulk of the CO(1-0) emission with rotating disks
and, after subtracting the best-fit models, we detect compact residual emission
at S/N=15 within $\sim3$kpc from the centre. A molecular outflow in NED01, if
present, cannot be brighter than such residuals, implying an upper limit on its
outflow rate of $\dot{M}^{mol}_{out} \lesssim 19\pm14~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ and on
its momentum rate of $\dot p^{mol}_{out} \lesssim (2.7\pm2.4) \times
10^{34}$gcms$^{-1}$. Combined with the revised energetics of the X-ray wind, we
derive an upper limit on the momentum rate ratio of
$\dot{p}^{mol}_{out}/\dot{p}^{X-ray}_{out}<0.67$. We discuss these results in
the context of the expectations of AGN feedback models, and we propose the
X-ray disk wind in NED01 has not significantly impacted the molecular gas
reservoir (yet), and we can constrain its effect to be much smaller than
expectations of AGN ''energy-driven'' feedback models. We also consider and
discuss the hypothesis of asymmetries of the molecular disk not properly
captured by the 3D-BAROLO code. Our results highlight the challenges in testing
the predictions of popular AGN disk-wind feedback theories, even with good
quality multi-wavelength observations.

Title: Revisiting the alignment of radio galaxies in the ELAIS-N1 field

  Aims. Previous studies reported an alignment of the major axes of radio
galaxies on various angular scales. Here, we study the alignment of radio
galaxies in the ELAIS-N1 Low Frequency ARray (LOFAR) deep field, which covers
an area of 25 $\rm deg^2$. \newline Methods. The low noise level of about 20$
\rm ~ \mu Jy/beam$ of the LOFAR deep field observations at 150 MHz enabled the
identification of 447 extended ($> 30 \rm ''$) radio galaxies for which we have
measured the major axis position angle. We found that 95\% of these sources
have either photometric or spectroscopic redshifts, which we then used for a
three-dimensional analysis. \newline Results. We show the distribution of the
position angles of radio galaxies in the ELAIS-N1 field and perform multiple
statistical tests to check whether the radio galaxies are randomly oriented. We
found that the distribution of position angles is consistent with being
uniform. Two peaks around position angles of 50 and 140$\rm~ deg$ are spurious
and are not caused by an alignment, as shown by a 3D analysis. In conclusion,
our results do not support a 2D or 3D alignment of radio galaxies on scales
smaller than $\sim 4 \rm ~ deg$.

Title: Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (SMUDGes). IV.
  Ultra-Diffuse Satellites of Milky Way Analogs
Authors: Hina Goto, Dennis Zaritsky, Ananthan Karunakaran, Richard Donnerstein,
  David J. Sand
Categories: astro-ph.GA
Comments: Submitted for publication. 12 pages, 6 figures
\\
  To better understand the formation of large, low surface brightness galaxies,
we measure the correlation function between ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG)
candidates and Milky Way analogs (MWAs). We find that (1) the projected radial
distribution of UDG satellites (projected surface density $\propto
r^{-0.84\pm0.06}$) is consistent with that of normal satellite galaxies, (2)
the number of UDG satellites per MWA ($S_{\rm UDG}$) is $\sim 0.5\pm0.1$ over
projected radii from 20 to 250 kpc and $-17< M_r < -13.5$, (3) $S_{\rm UDG}$ is
consistent with a linear extrapolation of the relationship between the number
of UDGs per halo vs. halo mass obtained over galaxy group and cluster scales,
(4) red UDG satellites dominate the population of UDG satellites ($\sim80$%),
(5) over the range of satellite magnitudes studied, UDG satellites comprise
$\sim$ 10% of the satellite galaxy population of MWAs, (6) a significant
fraction of these ($\sim$13%) have estimated total masses $>$ 10$^{10.9}$
M$_\odot$ or, equivalently, at least half the halo mass of the LMC, and
populate a large fraction ($\sim$ 18%) of the expected subhalos down to these
masses. All of these results suggest a close association between the overall
low mass galaxy population and UDGs, which we interpret as favoring models
where UDG formation principally occurs within the general context of low mass
galaxy formation over models invoking more exotic physical processes
specifically invoked to form UDGs.

Title: Discovery of Extended Fe Ka Complex X-ray Emission in NGC 5728
Authors: Anna Trindade Falcao, G. Fabbiano, M. Elvis, A. Paggi, W. P. Maksym
Categories: astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE
\\
  We present Chandra ACIS imaging spectroscopy results for the extended
(1.5$''$-8$''$) hard X-ray emission of the Compton thick (CT) Seyfert NGC 5728.
We find spectrally and spatially-resolved features in the Fe K$\alpha$ complex
(5.5-7.2 keV), redward and blueward of the neutral 6.4 keV line in the extended
bicone. The [red, blue] features have [6.5$\sigma$, 5.3$\sigma$] significance,
with an equivalent width = [1.76 keV, 2.60 keV], much higher than in the
nuclear spectrum. Hence these red and blue wings are extended in a few
arcsecond scale, as confirmed by narrow-band X-ray imaging. These energies
imply line-of-sight velocities of [$\sim$19,000-42,000, $\sim$ 28,000] km
s$^{-1}$, if the emission is due to neutral Fe K$\alpha$.

Title: Deep Chandra Observations of NGC 5728: Morphology and Spectral
  Properties of the Extended X-ray Emission
Authors: Anna Trindade Falcao, G. Fabbiano, M. Elvis, A. Paggi, W. P. Maksym
Categories: astro-ph.GA
\\
  Recent deep Chandra observations of nearby Compton thick (CT) AGN have
produced surprising results, uncovering extended emission not only in the soft
X-rays but in the hard emission (>3 keV), challenging the long-held belief that
the characteristic hard X-ray continuum and fluorescent Fe Ka lines are
associated with the torus in the standard picture of AGN. In this work, we
present the analysis of our deep (~261 ks) X-ray Chandra ACIS-S observations of
NGC 5728, a nearby (z=0.00932) CT AGN. We find that the diffuse emission is
more extended at lower energies, in the bicone direction out to ~2 kpc
radially, but also significantly extended in the direction of the cross-cone,
out to ~1.4 kpc. Our results suggest that the ratio of detected photons in the
cross-cone to the bicone region is ~16%, below 3 keV, decreasing to 5% for
energies 3-6 keV. The nuclear spectrum suggests a low photoionization phase
mixed with a more ionized gas component, while the bicone and cross-cone
spectra are dominated by a mix of photoionization and shocked gas emission. A
mixture of thermal and photoionization models to fit the spectra indicates the
presence of complex gas interactions, consistent with previous observations of
other CT AGN (e.g., ESO 428-G014).

Title: Quenching star formation with low-luminosity AGN winds
Authors: Ivan Almeida, Rodrigo Nemmen, and Rogemar Riffel
Categories: astro-ph.GA
Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS
\\
  We present a simple model for low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN)
feedback through thermal winds produced by a hot accretion flow. The wind
carries considerable energy and deposits it on the host galaxy at kiloparsec
scales and beyond, heating the galactic gas thereby quenching star formation.
Our model predicts that the typical LLAGN can quench more than $10\%$ of star
formation in its host galaxy. We find that long-lived LLAGN winds from
supermassive black holes (SMBH) with masses $\geq 10^8 M_{\odot}$ and mass
accretion rates $\dot{M} > 10^{-3}\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ can prevent gas collapse
and significantly quench galactic star formation compared to a scenario without
AGN, if the wind persists over 1 Myr. For sustained wind production over
timescales of 10 Myr or longer, SMBHs with $10^8 M_{\odot}$ or larger masses
have important feedback effects with $\dot{M} > 10^{-4} \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$.

Title: Distances to nearby molecular clouds traced by young stars
Authors: Miaomiao Zhang
Categories: astro-ph.GA
Comments: 31 pages; 11 figures; one of figures is a figset including 63
  components; figset can be obtained as part of source files; accepted by ApJS
\\
  I present a catalog of distances to 63 molecular clouds located within ~2.5
kpc of the Sun. The cloud distances are derived based on utilizing the Gaia DR3
parallaxes of the young stellar objects (YSOs). By identifying AllWISE YSO
candidates (YSOCs) with infrared excesses and combining them with published
YSOC catalogs, I compile an all-sky YSOC sample that is devoid of a significant
proportion of contaminants. Using Gaia DR3 astrometric measurements, I
associate over 3000 YSOCs with 63 local clouds and obtain the average distance
to each cloud by fitting the YSOC parallax distribution within the cloud. I
find good agreements with typical scatter of <10% between my new cloud
distances and previous distance estimates. Unlike cloud distances obtained
using stellar extinction, my catalog provides distances to the relatively dense
areas of local clouds, which makes them more appropriate references for
investigating the physical properties of nearby dense regions.

Title: Small-scale dynamo with finite correlation times
Authors: Yann Carteret, Dominik Schleicher and Jennifer Schober
Categories: astro-ph.GA physics.plasm-ph
\\
  Fluctuation dynamos occur in most turbulent plasmas in astrophysics and are
the prime candidates for amplifying and maintaining cosmic magnetic fields. A
few analytical models exist to describe their behaviour but they are based on
simplifying assumptions. For instance the well-known Kazantsev model assumes an
incompressible flow that is delta-correlated in time. However, these
assumptions can break down in the interstellar medium as it is highly
compressible and the velocity field has a finite correlation time. Using the
renewing flow method developed by Bhat and Subramanian (2014), we aim to extend
Kazantsev's results to a more general class of turbulent flows. The cumulative
effect of both compressibility and finite correlation time over the Kazantsev
spectrum is studied analytically. We derive an equation for the longitudinal
two-point magnetic correlation function in real space to first order in the
correlation time $\tau$ and for an arbitrary degree of compressibility (DOC).
This generalised Kazantsev equation encapsulates the original Kazantsev
equation. In the limit of small Strouhal numbers $St \propto \tau$ we use the
WKB approximation to derive the growth rate and scaling of the magnetic power
spectrum. We find the result that the Kazantsev spectrum is preserved, i.e.
$M_k(k)\sim k^{3/2}$. The growth rate is also negligibly affected by the finite
correlation time; however, it is reduced by the finite magnetic diffusivity,
and the DOC together.

  We combine the superior JWST/NIRCam imaging and MUSE data to characterize the
properties of galaxies in different environmental conditions in the cluster
Abell2744 (z=0.3064) and in its immediate surroundings. Our most striking
result is the discovery of a ``red-excess'' population in F200W-F444W colors
both in the cluster regions and the field. These galaxies have normal
F115W-F150W colors, but are up to 0.8 mag redder than red sequence galaxies in
F200W-F444W. They also have rather blue rest frame B-V colors. Galaxies with
the largest color deviations are found in the field and at the cluster virial
radius, suggesting that mechanisms taking place in these regions might be more
effective in producing these colors. Looking at their morphology, many cluster
galaxies show signatures consistent with ram pressure stripping, while field
galaxies have features resembling interactions and mergers. Our hypothesis is
that these galaxies are characterized by dust enshrouded star formation: a
JWST/NIRSpec spectrum for one of the galaxies is dominated by a strong PAH at
3.3mu m, suggestive of dust obscured star formation. Larger spectroscopic
samples are needed to understand if the color excess is due exclusively to
dust-obscured star formation, and the role of environment in triggering it.

Title: Observed UV continuum slopes ($\beta$) of galaxies at $z = 0.40-0.75$ in
  the GOODS-north field
Authors: Chayan Mondal, Kanak Saha, Rogier A. Windhorst, Rolf A. Jansen
Categories: astro-ph.GA
Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal
\\
  We estimate the UV continuum slope ($\beta$) of 465 galaxies (with
luminosities of 0.028 $-$ 3.3 $L^{*}_{z=0.5}$) in the Great Observatories
Origins Survey (GOODS) Northern field in the redshift range $z=0.40 - 0.75$. We
use two AstroSat/UVIT (N242W, N245M), two HST (F275W, F336W), and a KPNO (U)
bands to sample the UV continuum slope of selected galaxies between 1215 and
2600 angstrom. The mean (median) and 1$\sigma$ scatter in the observed $\beta$
are found to be $-1.33\pm0.07~(-1.32)$ and 0.60 within the considered redshift
range. We do not find any significant evolution in the mean $\beta$ within our
redshift window. Our measurements add new data points to the global $\beta$ -
$z$ relation in the least-explored redshift regime, further reinforcing the
gradual reddening of galaxy UV continuum with cosmic time. We notice no strong
consistent trend between $\beta$ and M$_{1500}$ for the entire luminosity range
$-21$ $< M_{1500} <-15$ mag. Although, the majority of the most luminous
galaxies (M$_{1500} <-19$ mag) are found to have relatively redder slopes.
Using UVIT, we detect galaxies as faint as M$_{1500} = -15.6$ mag (i.e., 0.028
$L^{*}_{z=0.5}$). The faintest galaxies (M$_{1500} > -16$ mag) tend to be
redder, which indicates they were less actively forming stars during this
cosmic time interval. Our study highlights the unique capability of UVIT
near-UV imaging to characterize the rest-frame far-UV properties of galaxies at
redshift $z \sim 0.5$.

Title: Excitation of Langmuir waves in the magnetospheres of AGN
Authors: Z.N. Osmanov
Categories: astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE physics.plasm-ph
Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures
\\
  In the paper we study the process of excitation of Langmuir waves in the
magnetospheres of active galactic nuclei (AGN), by taking a
general-relativistic expression of the Goldreich-Julian density into account.
We considered the linearised set of equations which describe dynamics of the
studied mechanism: the Euler equation, the continuity equation and the Poisson
equation. After solving the dispersion relation and obtaining the instability
growth rate, we explored it versus several physical parameters: electron's and
proton's relativistic factors and the mass and luminosity of AGN, which are
supposed to be Kerr black holes. We showed that the parametric process of
energy pumping into the Langmuir waves is very efficient and the electrostatic
field's amplitude will be exponentially amplifying, which might account for
pair creation, particle acceleration and plasma heating processes in the nearby
regions of AGN.

Title: Detailed shapes of the line-of-sight velocity distributions in massive
  early-type galaxies from non-parametric spectral models
Authors: Kianusch Mehrgan, Jens Thomas, Roberto Saglia, Taniya Parikh and Ralf
  Bender
Categories: astro-ph.GA
Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal
\\
  We present the first systematic study of the detailed shapes of the
line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs) in nine massive early-type
galaxies (ETGs) using the novel non-parametric modelling code WINGFIT.
High-signal spectral observations with MUSE at the VLT allow us to measure
between 40 and 400 individual LOSVDs in each galaxy at a signal-to-noise level
better than 100 per spectral bin and to trace the LOSVDs all the way out to the
highest stellar velocities. We extensively discuss potential LOSVD distortions
due to template mismatch and strategies to avoid them. Our analysis uncovers a
plethora of complex, large scale kinematic structures for the shapes of the
LOSVDs. Most notably, in the centers of all ETGs in our sample, we detect
faint, broad LOSVD ``wings'' extending the line-of-sight velocities, v_los,
well beyond 3 sigma to v_los = +- 1000 - 1500 km/s on both sides of the peak of
the LOSVDs. These wings likely originate from PSF effects and contain velocity
information about the very central unresolved regions of the galaxies. In
several galaxies, we detect wings of similar shape also towards the outer parts
of the MUSE field-of-view. We propose that these wings originate from faint
halos of loosely bound stars around the ETGs, similar to the cluster-bound
stellar envelopes found around many brightest cluster galaxies.

  Context: The first stars produced the first heavy elements and set the stage
for the formation of the first galaxies. Accurate chemical abundances of ultra
metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-4) can be used to infer properties of the first
stars, and thus the formation mechanism for low-mass second generation stars in
the early universe. Spectroscopic studies have shown that most second
generation stars are carbon-enhanced with one notable exception SDSS
J102915.14+172927.9. Aims: We reanalyse the composition of SDSS
J102915.14+172927.9. Methods: We developed a tailored 3D model atmosphere for
SDSS J102915.14+172927.9 with the Stagger-code, making use of an improved
surface gravity estimate based on the Gaia DR3 parallax. This model was used as
input in the radiative transfer code Balder to compute 3D non-LTE synthetic
spectra. These spectra were then used to infer abundances for Mg, Si, Ca, Fe
and Ni, and upper limits on Li, Na and Al. 3D LTE synthetic spectra were
computed with Scate to infer the abundance of Ti and upper limits on C and N.
Results: In contrast to earlier works based on 1D non-LTE corrections to 3D LTE
results, we are able to achieve ionisation balance for Ca I and Ca II when
employing our consistent 3D non-LTE treatment. Moreover, the elemental
abundances are systematically higher than those found in earlier works. In
particular, [Fe/H] increases by 0.57 dex, and the upper limits of C and N
increase by 0.90 dex and 1.82 dex, respectively. Conclusions: We find that
Population III progenitors with masses 10-20 M_sun exploding with energy
E<=3*10^{51} erg can reproduce our 3D non-LTE abundance pattern. Contrary to
previous work, we obtain higher upper limits on the carbon abundance that are
``marginally consistent'' with star formation through atomic line cooling, and
as such, prevent strong conclusions about the formation mechanism of this low
mass star.
