  The astronomical transient AT2018cow is the closest example of the new class
of luminous, fast blue optical transients (FBOTs). Liverpool Telescope RINGO3
observations of AT2018cow are reported here, which constitute the earliest
polarimetric observations of an FBOT. At 5.7 days post-explosion, the optical
emission of AT2018cow exhibited a chromatic polarization spike that reached ~7%
at red wavelengths. This is the highest intrinsic polarization recorded for a
non-relativistic explosive transient, and is observed in multiple bands and at
multiple epochs over the first night of observations, before rapidly declining.
The apparent wavelength dependence of the polarization may arise through
depolarization or dilution of the polarized flux, due to conditions in
AT~2018cow at early times. A second ``bump" in the polarization is observed at
blue wavelengths at ~12 days. Such a high polarization requires an extremely
aspherical geometry that is only apparent for a brief period (<1 day), such as
shock breakout through an optically thick disk. For a disk-like configuration,
the ratio of the thickness to radial extent must be ~10%.

  The trace magnetic power spectrum in the solar wind is known to be
characterized by a double power law at scales much larger than the proton
gyro-radius, with flatter spectral exponents close to -1 found at the lower
frequencies below an inertial range with indices closer to $[-1.5,-1.6]$. The
origin of the $1/f$ range is still under debate. In this study, we selected 109
magnetically incompressible solar wind intervals ($\delta |\boldsymbol
B|/|\boldsymbol B| \ll 1$) from Parker Solar Probe encounters 1 to 13 which
display such double power laws, with the aim of understanding the statistics
and radial evolution of the low frequency power spectral exponents from
Alfv\'en point up to 0.3 AU. New observations from closer to the sun show that
in the low frequency range solar wind turbulence can display spectra much
shallower than $1/f$, evolving asymptotically to $1/f$ as advection time
increases, indicating a dynamic origin for the $1/f$ range formation. We
discuss the implications of this result on the Matteini et al. (2018)
conjecture for the $1/f$ origin as well as example spectra displaying a triple
power law consistent with the model proposed by Chandran et al. (2018),
supporting the dynamic role of parametric decay in the young solar wind. Our
results provide new constraints on the origin of the $1/f$ spectrum and further
show the possibility of the coexistence of multiple formation mechanisms.

Title: Diving into the magnetosphere of the Of?p star HD108
Authors: Gregor Rauw, Ya\"el Naz\'e, Asif ud-Doula, Coralie Neiner
Categories: astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE
Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
\\
  We analyse optical and X-ray spectroscopy of the Of?p star HD108, known for
its strong dipolar magnetic field and its optical line profile variability with
a timescale of $54 \pm 3$ yrs, interpreted as the stellar rotation period.
Optical emission lines have now recovered from their minimum emission state
reached in 2007 - 2008. The variations of the equivalent width of the H$\alpha$
emission provide constraints on the inclination of the rotation axis ($i$) and
the obliquity of the magnetic axis ($\beta$). The best agreement between model
and observations is found for ($i$, $\beta$) pairs with $i + \beta \simeq
85^{\circ}$ and $i \in [30^{\circ},55^{\circ}]$. The Balmer emission lines
display stochastic variability at the $\sim 5$ % level on timescales of a few
days. TESS photometry unveils transient modulations on similar timescales in
addition to prominent red noise variations. A Chandra X-ray observation of
December 2021, when the star was at a higher emission level, indicates a slight
increase of the flux and a spectral hardening compared to the August 2002
XMM-Newton observation, taken near minimum emission state. Magnetohydrodynamic
simulations are used to compute synthetic X-ray spectra. With our current best
estimate of the $\dot{M}_{B=0}$ mass-loss rate, the simulated X-ray luminosity
and spectral energy distribution agree very well with the observations.
Finally, the radial velocities vary on a period of 8.5 years with a
peak-to-peak amplitude of 10 - 11 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting orbital motion with
an unseen companion of at least 4 M$_{\odot}$.

\\
  Analysis of bulk meteorite compositions has revealed small isotopic
variations due to the presence of material (e.g., stardust) that preserved the
signature of nuclear reactions occurring in specific stellar sites. The
interpretation of such anomalies provides evidence for the environment of the
birth of the Sun, its accretion process, the evolution of the solar
proto-planetary disk, and the formation of the planets. A crucial element of
such interpretation is the comparison of the observed anomalies to predictions
from models of stellar nucleosynthesis. To date, however, this comparison has
been limited to a handful of model predictions. This is mostly because the
calculated stellar abundances need to be transformed into a specific
representation, which nuclear astrophysicists and stellar nucleosynthesis
researchers are not familiar with. Here, we show in detail that this
representation is needed to account for mass fractionation effects in meteorite
data that can be generated both in nature and during instrumental analysis. We
explain the required internal normalisation to a selected isotopic ratio,
describe the motivations behind such representation more widely, and provide
the tools to perform the calculations. Then, we present some examples
considering two elements produced by the $slow$ neutron-capture ($s$) process:
Sr and Mo. We show which specific representations for the Sr isotopic
composition calculated by $s$-process models better disentangle the
nucleosynthetic signatures from stars of different metallicity. For Mo, the
comparison between data and models is improved due to a recent re-analysis of
the $^{95}$Mo neutron-capture cross section.

Title: No evidence for absence of solar dynamo synchronization
Authors: F. Stefani, J. Beer, T. Weier
Categories: astro-ph.SR astro-ph.EP
Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Context: The old question of whether the solar dynamo is synchronized by the
tidal forces of the orbiting planets has recently received renewed interest,
both from the viewpoint of historical data analysis and in terms of theoretical
and numerical modelling. Aims: We aim to contribute to the solution of this
longstanding puzzle by analyzing cosmogenic radionuclide data from the last
millennium. Methods: We reconsider a recent time-series of $^{14}$C-inferred
sunspot data and compare the resulting cycle minima and maxima with the
corresponding conventional series down to 1610 A.D., enhanced by Schove's data
before that time. Results: We find that, despite recent claims to the contrary,
the $^{14}$C-inferred sunspot data are well compatible with a synchronized
solar dynamo, exhibiting a relatively phase-stable period of 11.07 years, which
points to a synchronizing role of the spring tides of the Venus-Earth-Jupiter
system.

Comments: 35 pages, 11 figures, submitted to Space Science Reviews
\\
  We review the surface flux transport model for the evolution of magnetic flux
patterns on the Sun's surface. Our underlying motivation is to understand the
model's prediction of the polar field (or axial dipole) strength at the end of
the solar cycle. The main focus is on the "classical" model: namely, steady
axisymmetric profiles for differential rotation and meridional flow, and
uniform supergranular diffusion. Nevertheless, the review concentrates on
recent advances, notably in understanding the roles of transport parameters and
- in particular - the source term. We also discuss the physical justification
for the surface flux transport model, along with efforts to incorporate radial
diffusion, and conclude by summarizing the main directions where researchers
have moved beyond the classical model.

Title: Statistical analysis of the total magnetic flux decay rate in solar
  active regions
Authors: Andrei A. Plotnikov, Valentina I. Abramenko, Alexander S. Kutsenko
Categories: astro-ph.SR
\\
  We used line-of-sight magnetograms acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory to derive the decay rate of
total unsigned magnetic flux for 910 ephemeral and active regions (ARs)
observed between 2010 and 2017. We found that: i) most of the ARs obey the
power law dependence between the peak magnetic flux and the magnetic flux decay
rate, $DR$, so that $DR\sim \Phi^{0.70}$; ii) larger ARs lose smaller fraction
of their magnetic flux per unit of time than the smaller ARs; iii) there exists
a cluster of ARs exhibiting significantly lower decay rate than it would follow
from the power law and all of them are unipolar sunspots with total fluxes in
the narrow range of $(2 - 8) \times 10^{21}$ Mx; iv) a comparison with our
previous results shows that the emergence rate is always higher than the decay
rate. The emergence rate follows a power law with a shallower slope than the
slope of the decay-rate power law. The results allowed us to suggest that not
only the maximum total magnetic flux determines the character of the decaying
regime of the AR, some of the ARs end up as a slowly decaying unipolar sunspot;
there should be certain physical mechanisms to stabilize such a sunspot.

  We have performed a detailed spectral analysis of the helium-rich hot
subdwarf EC 20187-4939 using data obtained in the SALT survey of helium-rich
hot subdwarfs. We have measured its effective temperature, surface gravity and
chemical abundances from the spectrum. Its radius has also been determined by
fitting the spectral energy distribution using photometric data, from which a
mass of 0.44 Msun has been inferred using the measurement of surface gravity.
This star is particularly abundant in helium and nitrogen, whilst being both
carbon and oxygen-weak. The surface abundances and mass have been found to be
consistent with a helium white dwarf merger product. The abundance effects of
alpha captures on nitrogen during the merger process and possible connections
between EC 20187-4939 and other carbon-weak related objects are discussed.

  Context: The first stars produced the first heavy elements and set the stage
for the formation of the first galaxies. Accurate chemical abundances of ultra
metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-4) can be used to infer properties of the first
stars, and thus the formation mechanism for low-mass second generation stars in
the early universe. Spectroscopic studies have shown that most second
generation stars are carbon-enhanced with one notable exception SDSS
J102915.14+172927.9. Aims: We reanalyse the composition of SDSS
J102915.14+172927.9. Methods: We developed a tailored 3D model atmosphere for
SDSS J102915.14+172927.9 with the Stagger-code, making use of an improved
surface gravity estimate based on the Gaia DR3 parallax. This model was used as
input in the radiative transfer code Balder to compute 3D non-LTE synthetic
spectra. These spectra were then used to infer abundances for Mg, Si, Ca, Fe
and Ni, and upper limits on Li, Na and Al. 3D LTE synthetic spectra were
computed with Scate to infer the abundance of Ti and upper limits on C and N.
Results: In contrast to earlier works based on 1D non-LTE corrections to 3D LTE
results, we are able to achieve ionisation balance for Ca I and Ca II when
employing our consistent 3D non-LTE treatment. Moreover, the elemental
abundances are systematically higher than those found in earlier works. In
particular, [Fe/H] increases by 0.57 dex, and the upper limits of C and N
increase by 0.90 dex and 1.82 dex, respectively. Conclusions: We find that
Population III progenitors with masses 10-20 M_sun exploding with energy
E<=3*10^{51} erg can reproduce our 3D non-LTE abundance pattern. Contrary to
previous work, we obtain higher upper limits on the carbon abundance that are
``marginally consistent'' with star formation through atomic line cooling, and
as such, prevent strong conclusions about the formation mechanism of this low
mass star.

Title: A major asymmetric ice trap in a planet-forming disk IV. Nitric oxide

  [Abridged] Most well-resolved disks observed with ALMA show signs of dust
traps. These dust traps set the chemical composition of the planet forming
material in these disks, as the dust grains with their icy mantles are trapped
at specific radii and could deplete the gas and dust of volatiles at smaller
radii. In this work we analyse the first detection of nitric oxide (NO) in a
protoplanetary disk. We aim to constrain the nitrogen chemistry and the
gas-phase C/O ratio in the highly asymmetric dust trap in the Oph-IRS 48 disk.
We use ALMA observations of NO, CN, C$_2$H, and related molecules and model the
effect of the dust trap on the physical and chemical structure using the
thermochemical code DALI. Furthermore, we explore how ice sublimation
contributes to the observed emission lines. NO is only observed at the location
of the dust trap but CN and C$_2$H are not detected in the Oph-IRS 48 disk.
This results in an CN/NO column density ratio of $< 0.05$ and thus a low C/O
ratio at the location of the dust trap. The main gas-phase formation pathways
to NO through OH and NH in the fiducial model predict NO emission that is an
order of magnitude lower than is observed. The gaseous NO column density can be
increased by factors ranging from 2.8 to 10 when the H$_2$O and NH$_3$ gas
abundances are significantly boosted by ice sublimation. However, these models
are inconsistent with the upper limits on the H$_2$O and OH column densities
derived from observations. We propose that the NO emission in the Oph-IRS 48
disk is closely related to the nitrogen containing ices sublimating in the dust
trap. The non-detection of CN constrains the C/O ratio both inside and outside
the dust trap to be $< 1$ if all nitrogen initially starts as N$_2$ and $\leq
0.6$, consistent with the Solar value, if (part of) the nitrogen initially
starts as N or NH$_3$.

\\
  Recent VLBI monitoring has found transverse motions of the M87 jet. However,
due to the limited cadence of previous observations, details of the transverse
motion have not been fully revealed yet. We have regularly monitored the M87
jet at KVN and VERA Array (KaVA) 22 GHz from December 2013 to June 2016. The
average time interval of the observation is ~ 0.1 year, which is suitable for
tracking short-term structural changes. From these observations, the M87 jet is
well represented by double ridge lines in the region 2 - 12 mas from the core.
We found that the ridge lines exhibit transverse oscillations in all observed
regions with an average period of $0.94\pm0.12$ years. When the sinusoidal fit
is performed, we found that the amplitude of this oscillation is an order of
$\sim0.1$ mas, and the oscillations in the northern and southern limbs are
almost in phase. Considering the amplitude, it does not originate from Earth's
parallax. We propose possible scenarios of the transverse oscillation, such as
the propagation of jet instabilities or magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or
perturbed mass injection around magnetically dominated accretion flows.

  How black holes consume and eject matter has been the subject of intense
studies for more than 60 years. The luminosity of these systems are often
compared to the Eddington limit, the border at which the spherical accretion is
inhibited by the radiation pressure of photons it produces. The discovery of
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) showed that accretion can proceed even when
the apparent luminosity exceeds the Eddington limit (Kaaret et al. 2017). High
apparent luminosity might be produced by the beaming of the incident radiation
by a thick collimated outflow or by a truly super-Eddington accretion flow.
However, possibilities to study these outflows in detail are limited, as ULXs
are typically found in distant galaxies. Using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry
Explorer (IXPE, Weisskopf et al. 2022), we made the first measurement of X-ray
polarization in Galactic X-ray binary Cyg X-3. The detection of high,
$\approx$25\%, nearly energy-independent linear polarization, orthogonal to the
direction of the radio ejections, unambiguously indicates the primary source is
obscured and the observer on Earth only sees reflected and scattered light.
Modelling shows there is an optically thick envelope with a narrow funnel
around the primary X-ray source in the system. We derive an upper limit on the
opening angle of the funnel that implies a lower limit on the beamed luminosity
exceeding the Eddington value. We show that Cyg X-3 is viewed as a ULX to an
extragalactic observer located along the axis of the funnel. Our findings
reveal this unique persistent source as an ideal laboratory for the study of
the inner workings of ULX central engines.

  One of the fundamental open questions in space and astrophysical plasmas is
the nature of turbulence at the smallest, electron scales. This problem is
closely related to the presence of coherent structures such as current sheets,
that were shown to be formed out of this turbulence. The properties of
turbulence and associated current sheets have been investigated with a large
variety of plasma models. However, the effects of the electron inertia on those
processes have not been properly analyzed so far, especially in a
three-dimensional (3D) geometry. We investigate this problem by carrying out 3D
hybrid-kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of decaying turbulence with
our CHIEF code. The main distinguishing feature of this code is an
implementation of the electron inertia without approximations. We find that the
electron inertia plays a critical role in regulating and limiting the largest
values of current density in both real and wavenumber Fourier space, in
particular near and, unexpectedly, even above electron scales. In addition, a
comparison of current sheets formed in 2D vs 3D turbulence reveal that the
latter tend to have smaller values of current density, in particular near
electron scales. The electron inertia is thus of fundamental importance to
accurately describe the nature of plasma turbulence and current-sheet
properties near electron scales.

  Central Compact Objects (CCOs) are neutron stars found close to the centers
of some supernova remnants. Some of them are presumably covered by carbon
envelopes. Their unpulsed thermal X-ray emission can originate either from the
entire surface covered by a carbon atmosphere or a non-uniformly emitting
hydrogen atmosphere as an alternative. However, the latter scenario appears
unlikely given the available upper limits on the amplitude of pulsations. Here
we explore a possibility to further discriminate between the two scenarios
using X-ray polarimetric observations. We compute the polarization degree (PD)
for non-magnetized pure carbon and pure hydrogen atmospheres with effective
temperatures between 1 and 6 MK and find that it can reach up to 25% and 40%
for hydrogen and carbon atmospheres, respectively, in the photon energy band
1-10 keV. However, given the available constraints on possible inhomogeneities
of the temperature distribution deduced from modeling of the X-ray spectrum of
the CCO in HESS J1731-347, the integrated PD appears to be very low both for
carbon (<0.25%) and hydrogen (a few %) compositions in the energy band of 2-8
keV covered by the recently launched Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. We
conclude, therefore, that polarization from CCOs is not expected to be
detectable by current facilities, but future detection would strongly support
non-uniform hydrogen composition models.
