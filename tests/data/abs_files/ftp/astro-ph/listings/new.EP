  [Abridged] Most well-resolved disks observed with ALMA show signs of dust
traps. These dust traps set the chemical composition of the planet forming
material in these disks, as the dust grains with their icy mantles are trapped
at specific radii and could deplete the gas and dust of volatiles at smaller
radii. In this work we analyse the first detection of nitric oxide (NO) in a
protoplanetary disk. We aim to constrain the nitrogen chemistry and the
gas-phase C/O ratio in the highly asymmetric dust trap in the Oph-IRS 48 disk.
We use ALMA observations of NO, CN, C$_2$H, and related molecules and model the
effect of the dust trap on the physical and chemical structure using the
thermochemical code DALI. Furthermore, we explore how ice sublimation
contributes to the observed emission lines. NO is only observed at the location
of the dust trap but CN and C$_2$H are not detected in the Oph-IRS 48 disk.
This results in an CN/NO column density ratio of $< 0.05$ and thus a low C/O
ratio at the location of the dust trap. The main gas-phase formation pathways
to NO through OH and NH in the fiducial model predict NO emission that is an
order of magnitude lower than is observed. The gaseous NO column density can be
increased by factors ranging from 2.8 to 10 when the H$_2$O and NH$_3$ gas
abundances are significantly boosted by ice sublimation. However, these models
are inconsistent with the upper limits on the H$_2$O and OH column densities
derived from observations. We propose that the NO emission in the Oph-IRS 48
disk is closely related to the nitrogen containing ices sublimating in the dust
trap. The non-detection of CN constrains the C/O ratio both inside and outside
the dust trap to be $< 1$ if all nitrogen initially starts as N$_2$ and $\leq
0.6$, consistent with the Solar value, if (part of) the nitrogen initially
starts as N or NH$_3$.

Title: Evolution of the eccentricity and inclination of low-mass planets
  subjected to thermal forces: a numerical study
Authors: S. Cornejo, F. S. Masset, R. O. Chametla and S. Fromenteau
Categories: astro-ph.EP
Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
\\
  By means of three dimensional, high resolution hydrodynamical simulations we
study the orbital evolution of weakly eccentric or inclined low-mass
protoplanets embedded in gaseous discs subject to thermal diffusion. We
consider both non-luminous planets, and planets that also experience the
radiative feedback from their own luminosity. We compare our results to
previous analytical work, and find that thermal forces (the contribution to the
disc's force arising from thermal effects) match those predicted by linear
theory within $\sim 20$%. When the planet's luminosity exceeds a threshold
found to be within $10$% of that predicted by linear theory, its eccentricity
and inclination grow exponentially, whereas these quantities undergo a strong
damping below this threshold. In this regime of low luminosity indeed, thermal
diffusion cools the surroundings of the planet and allows gas to accumulate in
its vicinity. It is the dynamics of this gas excess that contributes to damp
eccentricity and inclination. The damping rates obtained can be up to $h^{-1}$
times larger than those due to the resonant interaction with the disc, where
$h$ is the disc's aspect ratio. This suggests that models that incorporate
planet-disc interactions using well-known formulae based on resonant
wave-launching to describe the evolution of eccentricity and inclination
underestimate the damping action of the disc on the eccentricity and
inclination of low-mass planets by an order of magnitude.

Title: Shape-Driven Selection Effects for Aspherical Near-Earth Objects in
  Systematic Surveys
Authors: W. Garrett Levine and Robert Jedicke
Categories: astro-ph.EP
Comments: 21 pages, 10 figure, 1 table. Accepted for publication in Icarus
\\
  The apparent magnitude of elongated small bodies is time-dependent over their
rotation phase. Therefore, previously undiscovered aspherical minor planets may
experience a shape-driven selection effect in systematic surveys versus their
spherical counterparts. In this study, we conduct injection-recovery exercises
of synthetic asteroid lightcurves using a simple model to quantify the effect
of varying axial ratio on detection efficiencies. We find that high-amplitude
lightcurves are confronted with adverse selection effects for survey cadences
and discovery thresholds for constructing tracklets that are representative of
modern and proposed future NEO searches. Furthermore, we illustrate the
possible hazards of drawing population-level inferences on an underlying
reservoir of elongated small bodies. If physical size and characteristic axial
ratios are correlated, then size-frequency distributions may require revision
at small diameters. In particular, this effect could alter the estimated
populations of near-Earth objects. We conclude by discussing the applicability
of our results to various other classes of solar system minor planets and
interstellar interlopers, as well as discuss future work that may further
interrogate this detection bias.

  We present the discovery of two planets around the solar twin HIP 104045 via
radial velocity data obtained with the ESO/HARPS spectrograph as part of the
Solar Twin Planet Search observing programme. The joint Keplerian and Gaussian
Process model fit accounting for both planetary and intrinsic stellar
modulations, as well as no timing-radial velocity correlations of several
activity tracers of the host star, reveal the presence of a Jupiter analogue
$m\sin{i}_b$ = 0.498$\pm$0.074 M$_{\rm Jup}$ under circular orbit with $P_b$ =
2315$\pm$310 days and a cold Super-Neptune $m\sin{i}_c$ = 43.15$\pm$10.3
M$_\oplus$ under circular orbit with $P_c$ = 316$\pm$75 days.

Title: Near-infrared Polarization Charateristics of the Zodiacal Light Observed
  with DIRBE/COBE
Authors: Kohji Takimoto, Shuji Matsuura, Kei Sano, and Richard M. Feder
Categories: astro-ph.EP
Comments: 11 pages, 12 figures, accepted by ApJ
\\
  We report near-infrared polarization of the zodiacal light (ZL) measured from
space by the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) on board the Cosmic
Background Explorer in photometric bands centered at 1.25, 2.2, and 3.5 $\mu$m.
To constrain the physical properties of interplanetary dust (IPD), we use DIRBE
Weekly Sky Maps to investigate the solar elongation ($\epsilon$), ecliptic
latitude ($\beta$), and wavelength ($\lambda$) dependence of ZL polarization.
We find that the polarization of the ZL varies as a function of $\epsilon$ and
$\beta$, consistent with observed polarization at $\lambda$ = 550 nm. While the
polarization dependence with wavelength at $(\epsilon$, $\beta)=(90^{\circ}$,
$0^{\circ})$ is modest (increasing from 17.7 $\pm$ 0.2% at 1.25 $\mu$m to 21.0
$\pm$ 0.3% at 3.5 $\mu$m), the variation is more pronounced at the North
Ecliptic Pole (23.1 $\pm$ 1.6, 35.1 $\pm$ 2.0 and 39.3 $\pm$ 2.1% at 1.25, 2.2
and 3.5 $\mu$m, respectively). The variation of ZL polarization with wavelength
is not explained by either Rayleigh scattering or by absorptive particles
larger than 10 $\mu$m.

Title: Robustness Measures for Molecular Detections using High-Resolution
  Transmission Spectroscopy of Exoplanets
Authors: Connor J. Cheverall, Nikku Madhusudhan, M{\aa}ns Holmberg
Categories: astro-ph.EP
Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
\\
  Ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy has emerged as a
promising technique for detecting chemicals in transiting exoplanetary
atmospheres. Despite chemical inferences in several exoplanets and previous
robustness studies, a robust and consistent detrending method to remove
telluric and stellar features from transmission spectra has yet to be agreed
upon. In this work we investigate the robustness of metrics used to optimise
PCA-based detrending for high-resolution transmission spectra of exoplanets in
the near-infrared. As a case study, we consider observations of the hot Jupiter
HD 189733 b obtained using the CARMENES spectrograph on the 3.5 m CAHA
telescope. We confirm that optimising the detrending parameters to maximise the
S/N of a cross-correlation signal in the presence of noise has the potential to
bias the detection significance at the planetary velocity of optimisation.
However, we find that optimisation using the difference between a
signal-injected cross-correlation function and the direct cross-correlation
function (CCF) is more robust against over-optimisation of noise and spurious
signals. We additionally examine the robustness of weighting the contribution
of each order to the final CCF, and of S/N calculations. Using a prescribed
robust methodology, we confirm H2O in the atmosphere of HD 189733 b (S/N =
6.1). We then investigate two further case studies, of exoplanets HD 209458 b
and WASP-76 b, confirming OH in the atmosphere of WASP-76 b (S/N = 4.7), and
demonstrating how non-robust methods may induce false positive or inflated
detections. Our findings pave the way towards a robust framework for
homogeneous characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres using high-resolution
transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared.

Title: One EURO for Uranus: the Elliptical Uranian Relativity Orbiter mission
Authors: Lorenzo Iorio, Athul P. Girija, Daniele Durante

Comments: LaTex2e, 38 pages, 7 figures, no tables
\\
  Recent years have seen an increasing interest in sending a mission to Uranus,
visited so far only by Voyager 2 in 1986. EURO (Elliptical Uranian Relativity
Orbiter) is a preliminary mission concept investigating the possibility of
dynamically measuring the planet's angular momentum ${\boldsymbol S}$ by means
of the Lense-Thirring effect affecting a putative Uranian orbiter. It is
possible, at least in principle, to separate the relativistic precessions of
the orbital inclination $I$ to the Celestial Equator and of the longitude of
the ascending node $\Omega$ of the spacecraft from its classical rates of the
pericentre $\omega$ induced by the multipoles $J_\ell,\,\ell=2,\,3,\,4,\ldots$
of the planet's gravity field by adopting an orbital plane containing the
planet's spin axis $\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$, perpendicular to the Celestial
Equator, and whose position in the latter is the same as of the projection of
$\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$ on to it. For a wide and elliptical $2\,000\times
100\,000\,\mathrm{km}$ orbit, the gravitomagnetic signatures amount to tens of
milliarcseconds per year, while, for a suitable choice of the initial
conditions, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the range-rate shift can reach the
level of $\simeq 1.5\times 10^{-3}$ millimetre per second in a single
pericentre passage of a few hours. By lowering the apocentre height to
$10\,000\,\mathrm{km}$, the Lense-Thirring precessions are enhanced to the
level of hundreds of milliarcseconds per year. The uncertainties in the
orientation of $\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$ and in $I$ are major sources of
systematic bias; it turns out that they should be determined with accuracies as
good as $\simeq 0.1-1$ and $\simeq 1-10$ milliarcseconds, respectively.

\\
  Analysis of bulk meteorite compositions has revealed small isotopic
variations due to the presence of material (e.g., stardust) that preserved the
signature of nuclear reactions occurring in specific stellar sites. The
interpretation of such anomalies provides evidence for the environment of the
birth of the Sun, its accretion process, the evolution of the solar
proto-planetary disk, and the formation of the planets. A crucial element of
such interpretation is the comparison of the observed anomalies to predictions
from models of stellar nucleosynthesis. To date, however, this comparison has
been limited to a handful of model predictions. This is mostly because the
calculated stellar abundances need to be transformed into a specific
representation, which nuclear astrophysicists and stellar nucleosynthesis
researchers are not familiar with. Here, we show in detail that this
representation is needed to account for mass fractionation effects in meteorite
data that can be generated both in nature and during instrumental analysis. We
explain the required internal normalisation to a selected isotopic ratio,
describe the motivations behind such representation more widely, and provide
the tools to perform the calculations. Then, we present some examples
considering two elements produced by the $slow$ neutron-capture ($s$) process:
Sr and Mo. We show which specific representations for the Sr isotopic
composition calculated by $s$-process models better disentangle the
nucleosynthetic signatures from stars of different metallicity. For Mo, the
comparison between data and models is improved due to a recent re-analysis of
the $^{95}$Mo neutron-capture cross section.

Title: Auroral, Ionospheric and Ground Magnetic Signatures of Magnetopause

  Surface waves on Earth's magnetopause have a controlling effect upon global
magnetospheric dynamics. Since spacecraft provide sparse in situ observation
points, remote sensing these modes using ground-based instruments in the polar
regions is desirable. However, many open conceptual questions on the expected
signatures remain. Therefore, we provide predictions of key qualitative
features expected in auroral, ionospheric, and ground magnetic observations
through both magnetohydrodynamic theory and a global coupled
magnetosphere-ionosphere simulation of a magnetopause surface eigenmode. These
show monochromatic oscillatory field-aligned currents, due to both the surface
mode and its non-resonant Alfv\'en coupling, are present throughout the
magnetosphere. The currents peak in amplitude at the equatorward edge of the
magnetopause boundary layer, not the open-closed boundary as previously
thought. They also exhibit slow poleward phase motion rather than being purely
evanescent. We suggest the upward field-aligned current perturbations may
result in periodic auroral brightenings. In the ionosphere, convection vortices
circulate the poleward moving field-aligned current structures. Finally,
surface mode signals are predicted in the ground magnetic field, with
ionospheric Hall currents rotating perturbations by approximately (but not
exactly) 90{\deg} compared to the magnetosphere. Thus typical dayside
magnetopause surface modes should be strongest in the East-West ground magnetic
field component. Overall, all ground-based signatures of the magnetopause
surface mode are predicted to have the same frequency across L-shells,
amplitudes that maximise near the magnetopause's equatorward edge, and larger
latitudinal scales than for field line resonance. Implications in terms of
ionospheric Joule heating and geomagnetically induced currents are discussed.

Title: No evidence for absence of solar dynamo synchronization
Authors: F. Stefani, J. Beer, T. Weier
Categories: astro-ph.SR astro-ph.EP
Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Context: The old question of whether the solar dynamo is synchronized by the
tidal forces of the orbiting planets has recently received renewed interest,
both from the viewpoint of historical data analysis and in terms of theoretical
and numerical modelling. Aims: We aim to contribute to the solution of this
longstanding puzzle by analyzing cosmogenic radionuclide data from the last
millennium. Methods: We reconsider a recent time-series of $^{14}$C-inferred
sunspot data and compare the resulting cycle minima and maxima with the
corresponding conventional series down to 1610 A.D., enhanced by Schove's data
before that time. Results: We find that, despite recent claims to the contrary,
the $^{14}$C-inferred sunspot data are well compatible with a synchronized
solar dynamo, exhibiting a relatively phase-stable period of 11.07 years, which
points to a synchronizing role of the spring tides of the Venus-Earth-Jupiter
system.
