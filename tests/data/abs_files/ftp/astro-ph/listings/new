Title: Census of Gaseous Satellites around Local Spiral Galaxies
Authors: Jingyao Zhu and Mary E Putman
Categories: astro-ph.GA
Comments: 18 pages, 13 figures, accepted by MNRAS
\\
  We present a search for gas-containing dwarf galaxies as satellite systems
around nearby spiral galaxies using 21 cm neutral hydrogen (HI) data from the
Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) Survey. We have identified 15 spiral
`primary' galaxies in a local volume of 10 Mpc with a range of total masses,
and have found 19 gas-containing dwarf satellite candidates within the
primaries' virial volumes ($R_{200}$) and 46 candidates within $2R_{200}$. Our
sensitivity using ALFALFA data converts to $M_{\rm HI} \approx 7.4 \times
10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$ at 10 Mpc, which includes 13 of the 26 gaseous dwarf
galaxies in the Local Group, and the HI properties of our sample are overall
similar to these 13. We found $0-3$ gaseous satellites per host galaxy within
$R_{200}$ and $0-5$ within $2R_{200}$, which agrees with the low numbers
present for the Milky Way and M31. There is also agreement with the
star-forming satellite numbers per host in the deep optical surveys SAGA and
ELVES, and the Auriga cosmological simulations. When scaled to $R_{200}$, the
optical surveys do not show a trend of increasing quenched fraction with host
mass; there is a slight increase in the total number of gaseous satellites with
host mass for our sample. The low numbers of gaseous/star-forming satellites
around spiral hosts are consistent with the idea that a universal and effective
satellite quenching mechanism, such as ram pressure stripping by the host halo,
is likely at play.

Title: Nucleosynthesis in outflows of compact objects and detection prospects
  of associated kilonovae
Authors: Nick Ekanger, Mukul Bhattacharya, Shunsaku Horiuchi
Categories: astro-ph.HE
Comments: 14 pages, 5+3 figures, 1 table. Comments welcome
\\
  We perform a comparative analysis of nucleosynthesis yields from binary
neutron star (BNS) mergers, black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers, and
core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with the goal of determining which are the
most dominant sources of r-process enrichment observed in stars. We find that
BNS and BHNS binaries may eject similar mass distributions of robust r-process
nuclei post merger (up to 3rd peak and actinides, $A\sim200-240$), after
accounting for the volumetric event rates. Magnetorotational (MR) CCSNe likely
undergo a weak r-process (up to $A\sim140$) and contribute to the production of
light element primary process (LEPP) nuclei, whereas typical thermal,
neutrino-driven CCSNe only synthesize up to 1st r-process peak nuclei
($A\sim80-90$). We also find that the upper limit to the rate of MR CCSNe is
$\lesssim1\%$ the rate of typical thermal CCSNe; if the rate was higher, then
weak r-process nuclei would be overproduced. Although the largest uncertainty
is from the volumetric event rate, the prospects are encouraging for confirming
these rates in the next few years with upcoming surveys. Using a simple model
to estimate the resulting kilonova light curve from mergers and our set of
fiducial merger parameters, we predict that $\sim7$ BNS and $\sim2$ BHNS events
will be detectable per year by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST), with prior
gravitational wave (GW) triggers.

  Massive black hole (BH) mergers will be key targets of future gravitational
wave and electromagnetic observational facilities. In order to constrain BH
evolution with the information extracted from BH mergers, one must take into
account the complex relationship between the population of merging BHs and the
global BH population. We analyse the high-resolution cosmological
radiation-hydrodynamics simulation Obelisk, run to redshift $z=3.5$, to study
the properties of the merging BH population, and its differences with the
underlying global BH population in terms of BH and galaxy properties. We
calculate in post-processing dynamical delays between the merger in the
simulation at the resolution limit and the actual coalescence well below the
resolution scale. We find that merging BHs are hosted in relatively massive
galaxies with stellar mass $M_\ast\gtrsim10^9\,M_\odot$. Given that galaxy mass
is correlated with other BH and galaxy properties, BH mergers tend to also have
higher total BH mass and higher BH accretion rates than the global population
of main BHs. These differences generally disappear if the merger population is
compared with a BH population sampled with the same galaxy mass distribution as
merger hosts. Galaxy mergers can temporarily boost the BH accretion rate and
the host's star formation rate, which can remain active at the BH merger if
sub-resolution delays are not taken into account. When dynamical delays are
taken into account the burst has generally faded by the time the BHs merge. BH
spins are followed self-consistently in the simulation, under the effect of
accretion and BH mergers. We find that merging BHs have higher spins than the
global population, but similar or somewhat lower spins compared to a
mass-matched sample. For our sample, mergers tend to decrease the spin of the
final BH remnant.

Title: A major asymmetric ice trap in a planet-forming disk IV. Nitric oxide

  [Abridged] Most well-resolved disks observed with ALMA show signs of dust
traps. These dust traps set the chemical composition of the planet forming
material in these disks, as the dust grains with their icy mantles are trapped
at specific radii and could deplete the gas and dust of volatiles at smaller
radii. In this work we analyse the first detection of nitric oxide (NO) in a
protoplanetary disk. We aim to constrain the nitrogen chemistry and the
gas-phase C/O ratio in the highly asymmetric dust trap in the Oph-IRS 48 disk.
We use ALMA observations of NO, CN, C$_2$H, and related molecules and model the
effect of the dust trap on the physical and chemical structure using the
thermochemical code DALI. Furthermore, we explore how ice sublimation
contributes to the observed emission lines. NO is only observed at the location
of the dust trap but CN and C$_2$H are not detected in the Oph-IRS 48 disk.
This results in an CN/NO column density ratio of $< 0.05$ and thus a low C/O
ratio at the location of the dust trap. The main gas-phase formation pathways
to NO through OH and NH in the fiducial model predict NO emission that is an
order of magnitude lower than is observed. The gaseous NO column density can be
increased by factors ranging from 2.8 to 10 when the H$_2$O and NH$_3$ gas
abundances are significantly boosted by ice sublimation. However, these models
are inconsistent with the upper limits on the H$_2$O and OH column densities
derived from observations. We propose that the NO emission in the Oph-IRS 48
disk is closely related to the nitrogen containing ices sublimating in the dust
trap. The non-detection of CN constrains the C/O ratio both inside and outside
the dust trap to be $< 1$ if all nitrogen initially starts as N$_2$ and $\leq
0.6$, consistent with the Solar value, if (part of) the nitrogen initially
starts as N or NH$_3$.

  Galaxy-scale strong lenses in galaxy clusters provide a unique tool to
investigate their inner mass distribution and the sub-halo density profiles in
the low-mass regime, which can be compared with the predictions from
cosmological simulations. We search for galaxy-galaxy strong-lensing systems in
HST multi-band imaging of galaxy cluster cores from the CLASH and HFF programs
by exploring the classification capabilities of deep learning techniques.
Convolutional neural networks are trained utilising highly-realistic
simulations of galaxy-scale strong lenses injected into the HST cluster fields
around cluster members. To this aim, we take advantage of extensive
spectroscopic information on member galaxies in 16 clusters and the accurate
knowledge of the deflection fields in half of these from high-precision strong
lensing models. Using observationally-based distributions, we sample
magnitudes, redshifts and sizes of the background galaxy population. By placing
these sources within the secondary caustics associated with cluster galaxies,
we build a sample of ~3000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses which preserve the full
complexity of real multi-colour data and produce a wide diversity of strong
lensing configurations. We study two deep learning networks processing a large
sample of image cutouts in three HST/ACS bands, and we quantify their
classification performance using several standard metrics. We find that both
networks achieve a very good trade-off between purity and completeness
(85%-95%), as well as good stability with fluctuations within 2%-4%. We
characterise the limited number of false negatives and false positives in terms
of the physical properties of the background sources and cluster members. We
also demonstrate the neural networks' high degree of generalisation by applying
our method to HST observations of 12 clusters with previously known
galaxy-scale lensing systems.

  We present ALMA CO(1-0) observations of the nearby LIRG galaxy pair
IRAS05054+1718 with a new analysis of X-ray data collected between 2012 and
2021 using NuSTAR, Swift, and XMM-Newton. The western component of the pair,
NED01, hosts a Seyfert 1.9 nucleus launching a powerful X-ray UFO. Our X-ray
spectral analysis suggests the UFO could be variable or multi-component in
velocity and constrains its momentum flux to $\dot p^{X-ray}_{out} \sim
(4\pm2)\times 10^{34}$ gcms$^{-2}$. ALMA CO(1-0) observations include also the
eastern component of the pair, a LIRG with no clear evidence for an AGN. We
study the CO(1-0) kinematics in the two galaxies using the 3D-BAROLO code. In
both sources, we can model the bulk of the CO(1-0) emission with rotating disks
and, after subtracting the best-fit models, we detect compact residual emission
at S/N=15 within $\sim3$kpc from the centre. A molecular outflow in NED01, if
present, cannot be brighter than such residuals, implying an upper limit on its
outflow rate of $\dot{M}^{mol}_{out} \lesssim 19\pm14~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ and on
its momentum rate of $\dot p^{mol}_{out} \lesssim (2.7\pm2.4) \times
10^{34}$gcms$^{-1}$. Combined with the revised energetics of the X-ray wind, we
derive an upper limit on the momentum rate ratio of
$\dot{p}^{mol}_{out}/\dot{p}^{X-ray}_{out}<0.67$. We discuss these results in
the context of the expectations of AGN feedback models, and we propose the
X-ray disk wind in NED01 has not significantly impacted the molecular gas
reservoir (yet), and we can constrain its effect to be much smaller than
expectations of AGN ''energy-driven'' feedback models. We also consider and
discuss the hypothesis of asymmetries of the molecular disk not properly
captured by the 3D-BAROLO code. Our results highlight the challenges in testing
the predictions of popular AGN disk-wind feedback theories, even with good
quality multi-wavelength observations.

  Aims. Previous studies reported an alignment of the major axes of radio
galaxies on various angular scales. Here, we study the alignment of radio
galaxies in the ELAIS-N1 Low Frequency ARray (LOFAR) deep field, which covers
an area of 25 $\rm deg^2$. \newline Methods. The low noise level of about 20$
\rm ~ \mu Jy/beam$ of the LOFAR deep field observations at 150 MHz enabled the
identification of 447 extended ($> 30 \rm ''$) radio galaxies for which we have
measured the major axis position angle. We found that 95\% of these sources
have either photometric or spectroscopic redshifts, which we then used for a
three-dimensional analysis. \newline Results. We show the distribution of the
position angles of radio galaxies in the ELAIS-N1 field and perform multiple
statistical tests to check whether the radio galaxies are randomly oriented. We
found that the distribution of position angles is consistent with being
uniform. Two peaks around position angles of 50 and 140$\rm~ deg$ are spurious
and are not caused by an alignment, as shown by a 3D analysis. In conclusion,
our results do not support a 2D or 3D alignment of radio galaxies on scales
smaller than $\sim 4 \rm ~ deg$.

Title: Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (SMUDGes). IV.
  Ultra-Diffuse Satellites of Milky Way Analogs
Authors: Hina Goto, Dennis Zaritsky, Ananthan Karunakaran, Richard Donnerstein,
  David J. Sand
Categories: astro-ph.GA
Comments: Submitted for publication. 12 pages, 6 figures
\\
  To better understand the formation of large, low surface brightness galaxies,
we measure the correlation function between ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG)
candidates and Milky Way analogs (MWAs). We find that (1) the projected radial
distribution of UDG satellites (projected surface density $\propto
r^{-0.84\pm0.06}$) is consistent with that of normal satellite galaxies, (2)
the number of UDG satellites per MWA ($S_{\rm UDG}$) is $\sim 0.5\pm0.1$ over
projected radii from 20 to 250 kpc and $-17< M_r < -13.5$, (3) $S_{\rm UDG}$ is
consistent with a linear extrapolation of the relationship between the number
of UDGs per halo vs. halo mass obtained over galaxy group and cluster scales,
(4) red UDG satellites dominate the population of UDG satellites ($\sim80$%),
(5) over the range of satellite magnitudes studied, UDG satellites comprise
$\sim$ 10% of the satellite galaxy population of MWAs, (6) a significant
fraction of these ($\sim$13%) have estimated total masses $>$ 10$^{10.9}$
M$_\odot$ or, equivalently, at least half the halo mass of the LMC, and
populate a large fraction ($\sim$ 18%) of the expected subhalos down to these
masses. All of these results suggest a close association between the overall
low mass galaxy population and UDGs, which we interpret as favoring models
where UDG formation principally occurs within the general context of low mass
galaxy formation over models invoking more exotic physical processes
specifically invoked to form UDGs.

Authors: Anna Trindade Falcao, G. Fabbiano, M. Elvis, A. Paggi, W. P. Maksym
Categories: astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE

  We present Chandra ACIS imaging spectroscopy results for the extended
(1.5$''$-8$''$) hard X-ray emission of the Compton thick (CT) Seyfert NGC 5728.
We find spectrally and spatially-resolved features in the Fe K$\alpha$ complex
(5.5-7.2 keV), redward and blueward of the neutral 6.4 keV line in the extended
bicone. The [red, blue] features have [6.5$\sigma$, 5.3$\sigma$] significance,
with an equivalent width = [1.76 keV, 2.60 keV], much higher than in the
nuclear spectrum. Hence these red and blue wings are extended in a few
arcsecond scale, as confirmed by narrow-band X-ray imaging. These energies
imply line-of-sight velocities of [$\sim$19,000-42,000, $\sim$ 28,000] km
s$^{-1}$, if the emission is due to neutral Fe K$\alpha$.

  The astronomical transient AT2018cow is the closest example of the new class
of luminous, fast blue optical transients (FBOTs). Liverpool Telescope RINGO3
observations of AT2018cow are reported here, which constitute the earliest
polarimetric observations of an FBOT. At 5.7 days post-explosion, the optical
emission of AT2018cow exhibited a chromatic polarization spike that reached ~7%
at red wavelengths. This is the highest intrinsic polarization recorded for a
non-relativistic explosive transient, and is observed in multiple bands and at
multiple epochs over the first night of observations, before rapidly declining.
The apparent wavelength dependence of the polarization may arise through
depolarization or dilution of the polarized flux, due to conditions in
AT~2018cow at early times. A second ``bump" in the polarization is observed at
blue wavelengths at ~12 days. Such a high polarization requires an extremely
aspherical geometry that is only apparent for a brief period (<1 day), such as
shock breakout through an optically thick disk. For a disk-like configuration,
the ratio of the thickness to radial extent must be ~10%.

Title: Deep Chandra Observations of NGC 5728: Morphology and Spectral
  Properties of the Extended X-ray Emission
Authors: Anna Trindade Falcao, G. Fabbiano, M. Elvis, A. Paggi, W. P. Maksym
Categories: astro-ph.GA
\\
  Recent deep Chandra observations of nearby Compton thick (CT) AGN have
produced surprising results, uncovering extended emission not only in the soft
X-rays but in the hard emission (>3 keV), challenging the long-held belief that
the characteristic hard X-ray continuum and fluorescent Fe Ka lines are
associated with the torus in the standard picture of AGN. In this work, we
present the analysis of our deep (~261 ks) X-ray Chandra ACIS-S observations of
NGC 5728, a nearby (z=0.00932) CT AGN. We find that the diffuse emission is
more extended at lower energies, in the bicone direction out to ~2 kpc
radially, but also significantly extended in the direction of the cross-cone,
out to ~1.4 kpc. Our results suggest that the ratio of detected photons in the
cross-cone to the bicone region is ~16%, below 3 keV, decreasing to 5% for
energies 3-6 keV. The nuclear spectrum suggests a low photoionization phase
mixed with a more ionized gas component, while the bicone and cross-cone
spectra are dominated by a mix of photoionization and shocked gas emission. A
mixture of thermal and photoionization models to fit the spectra indicates the
presence of complex gas interactions, consistent with previous observations of
other CT AGN (e.g., ESO 428-G014).

Title: Quenching star formation with low-luminosity AGN winds
Authors: Ivan Almeida, Rodrigo Nemmen, and Rogemar Riffel
Categories: astro-ph.GA
Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS
\\
  We present a simple model for low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN)
feedback through thermal winds produced by a hot accretion flow. The wind
carries considerable energy and deposits it on the host galaxy at kiloparsec
scales and beyond, heating the galactic gas thereby quenching star formation.
Our model predicts that the typical LLAGN can quench more than $10\%$ of star
formation in its host galaxy. We find that long-lived LLAGN winds from
supermassive black holes (SMBH) with masses $\geq 10^8 M_{\odot}$ and mass
accretion rates $\dot{M} > 10^{-3}\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ can prevent gas collapse
and significantly quench galactic star formation compared to a scenario without
AGN, if the wind persists over 1 Myr. For sustained wind production over
timescales of 10 Myr or longer, SMBHs with $10^8 M_{\odot}$ or larger masses
have important feedback effects with $\dot{M} > 10^{-4} \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$.

  The trace magnetic power spectrum in the solar wind is known to be
characterized by a double power law at scales much larger than the proton
gyro-radius, with flatter spectral exponents close to -1 found at the lower
frequencies below an inertial range with indices closer to $[-1.5,-1.6]$. The
origin of the $1/f$ range is still under debate. In this study, we selected 109
magnetically incompressible solar wind intervals ($\delta |\boldsymbol
B|/|\boldsymbol B| \ll 1$) from Parker Solar Probe encounters 1 to 13 which
display such double power laws, with the aim of understanding the statistics
and radial evolution of the low frequency power spectral exponents from
Alfv\'en point up to 0.3 AU. New observations from closer to the sun show that
in the low frequency range solar wind turbulence can display spectra much
shallower than $1/f$, evolving asymptotically to $1/f$ as advection time
increases, indicating a dynamic origin for the $1/f$ range formation. We
discuss the implications of this result on the Matteini et al. (2018)
conjecture for the $1/f$ origin as well as example spectra displaying a triple
power law consistent with the model proposed by Chandran et al. (2018),
supporting the dynamic role of parametric decay in the young solar wind. Our
results provide new constraints on the origin of the $1/f$ spectrum and further
show the possibility of the coexistence of multiple formation mechanisms.

Title: Evolution of the eccentricity and inclination of low-mass planets
  subjected to thermal forces: a numerical study
Authors: S. Cornejo, F. S. Masset, R. O. Chametla and S. Fromenteau
Categories: astro-ph.EP
Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
\\
  By means of three dimensional, high resolution hydrodynamical simulations we
study the orbital evolution of weakly eccentric or inclined low-mass
protoplanets embedded in gaseous discs subject to thermal diffusion. We
consider both non-luminous planets, and planets that also experience the
radiative feedback from their own luminosity. We compare our results to
previous analytical work, and find that thermal forces (the contribution to the
disc's force arising from thermal effects) match those predicted by linear
theory within $\sim 20$%. When the planet's luminosity exceeds a threshold
found to be within $10$% of that predicted by linear theory, its eccentricity
and inclination grow exponentially, whereas these quantities undergo a strong
damping below this threshold. In this regime of low luminosity indeed, thermal
diffusion cools the surroundings of the planet and allows gas to accumulate in
its vicinity. It is the dynamics of this gas excess that contributes to damp
eccentricity and inclination. The damping rates obtained can be up to $h^{-1}$
times larger than those due to the resonant interaction with the disc, where
$h$ is the disc's aspect ratio. This suggests that models that incorporate
planet-disc interactions using well-known formulae based on resonant
wave-launching to describe the evolution of eccentricity and inclination
underestimate the damping action of the disc on the eccentricity and
inclination of low-mass planets by an order of magnitude.

  The brightest Gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A, has spurred numerous theoretical
investigations, with particular attention paid to the origins of ultra-high
energy TeV photons during the prompt phase. However, analyzing the mechanism of
radiation of photons in the $\sim$MeV range has been difficult because the high
flux causes pile-up and saturation effects in most GRB detectors. In this
letter, we present systematic modeling of the time-resolved spectra of the GRB
using unsaturated data obtained from Fermi/GBM (precursor) and
SATech-01/GECAM-C (main emission and flare). Our approach incorporates the
synchrotron radiation model, which assumes an expanding emission region with
relativistic speed and a global magnetic field that decays with radius, and
successfully fits such a model to the observational data. Our results indicate
that the spectra of the burst are fully in accordance with a synchrotron origin
from relativistic electrons accelerated at a large emission radius. The lack of
thermal emission in the prompt emission spectra supports a
Poynting-flux-dominated jet composition.

  Diffusion damping of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum
results from imperfect photon-baryon coupling in the pre-recombination plasma.
At redshift $5 \times 10^4 < z < 2 \times 10^6$, the plasma acquires an
effective chemical potential, and energy injections from acoustic damping in
this era create $\mu$-type spectral distortions of the CMB. These $\mu$
distortions trace the underlying photon density fluctuations, probing the
primordial power spectrum in short-wavelength modes $k_\mathrm{S}$ over the
range $50 \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim 10^4 \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.
Small-scale power modulated by long-wavelength modes $k_\mathrm{L}$ from
squeezed-limit non-Gaussianities introduces cross-correlations between CMB
temperature anisotropies and $\mu$ distortions. Under single-field inflation
models, $\mu \times T$ correlations measured from an observer in an inertial
frame should vanish up to a factor of $(k_\mathrm{L}/k_\mathrm{S})^2 \ll 1$.
Thus, any measurable correlation rules out single-field inflation models. We
forecast how well the next-generation ground-based CMB experiment CMB-S4 will
be able to constrain primordial squeezed-limit non-Gaussianity, parameterized
by $f_\mathrm{NL}$, using measurements of $C_{\ell}^{\mu T}$ as well as
$C_{\ell}^{\mu E}$ from CMB $E$ modes. Using current experimental
specifications and foreground modeling, we expect $\sigma(f_\mathrm{NL})
\lesssim 1000$. This is roughly four times better than the current limit on
$f_\mathrm{NL}$ using $\mu \times T$ and $\mu \times E$ correlations from
Planck and is comparable to what is achievable with LiteBIRD, demonstrating the
power of the CMB-S4 experiment. This measurement is at an effective scale of $k
\simeq 740 \ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and is thus highly complementary to measurements
at larger scales from primary CMB and large-scale structure.

Title: A Model-Independent Determination of Red Noise in Pulsar Timing Arrivals
Authors: Reinabelle Reyes and Christopher C. Bernido

Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to Frontiers in Astronomy and Space
  Sciences
\\
  Noise is ubiquitous in pulsar signals where red noise has been attributed to
effects arising from the interstellar medium, spin noise, and pulsar mode
changes, among others. The red noise, however, has not been detected in all
pulsars. Using the dataset from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for
Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), we investigate twenty-three pulsars and show
that an evaluation of the mean square deviation and probability distribution of
timing residuals can provide a straightforward way of determining the presence
of red noise. The results agree with those reported in the literature. The
model-free method presented could complement the normally more sophisticated
model-dependent way of determining red noise in timing residuals.

Title: Observational constraints on non-cold dark matter and phenomenological
  emergent dark energy
Authors: Yan-Hong Yao, Jun-Chao Wang, Xin-He Meng
Categories: astro-ph.CO
Comments: 7 pages, 2 figure
\\
  Although almost all of the models proposed to resolve several long-standing
problems making $\Lambda$CDM imperfect assume that dark matter is pressureless,
the probability that dark matter is non-cold is still not excluded by current
observations. Therefore, in this article, we treat the equation of state for
dark matter as a free parameter, and apply observational data to investigate
the non-coldness of dark matter. Impressing by the simplicity of the
phenomenological emergent dark energy (PEDE) and its ability to relieve the
Hubble tension, we propose the PEDE+$w$DM model based on PEDE and non-cold dark
matter. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic
oscillation(BAO) measurements and the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia
supernovae. The results indicate a preference for a negative dark matter
equation of state at $95\%$ CL for all data sets except CMB alone, which
suggests that the non-coldness assumption of dark matter worth to be
investigated further in order to understand the nature of dark matter.

  Electromagnetic interference (EMI) for low-temperature detectors is a serious
concern in many missions. We investigate the EMI caused by the spacecraft
components to the x-ray microcalorimeter of the Resolve instrument onboard the
X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), which is currently under
development by an international collaboration and is planned to be launched in
2023. We focus on the EMI from (a) the low-frequency magnetic field generated
by the magnetic torquers (MTQ) used for the spacecraft attitude control and (b)
the radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic field generated by the S and X band
antennas used for communication between the spacecraft and the ground stations.
We executed a series of ground tests both at the instrument and spacecraft
levels using the flight-model hardware in 2021-2022 in a JAXA facility in
Tsukuba. We also conducted electromagnetic simulations partially using the
Fugaku high-performance computing facility. The MTQs were found to couple with
the microcalorimeter, which we speculate through pick-ups of low-frequency
magnetic field and further capacitive coupling. There is no evidence that the
resultant energy resolution degradation is beyond the current allocation of
noise budget. The RF communication system was found to leave no significant
effect. We present the result of the tests and simulation in this article.

Title: Implications of multi-axion dark matter on structure formation

  Axions are candidates for dark matter in the universe. We developed an
accurate numerical code to study multi-axion dark matter. As an interesting
example, we investigate a mixed dark matter model consisting of cold dark
matter (CDM) and two-axion dark matter. We analyze the growth of the structure
numerically and analytically. We find that an effective single axion with an
effective mass and an effective abundance is useful to characterize the
two-axion cosmology. Moreover, we generalize the effective single axion
description to multi-axion dark matter cosmology. We also compare the results
with those of warm dark matter (WDM) model. Moreover, we calculate halo mass
functions for the mixed model and determine the mass function as a function of
masses and axion abundance.

  Low-temperature detectors often use mechanical coolers as part of the cooling
chain in order to reach sub-Kelvin operating temperatures. The microphonics
noise caused by the mechanical coolers is a general and inherent issue for
these detectors. We have observed this effect in the ground test data obtained
with the Resolve instrument to be flown on the XRISM satellite. Resolve is a
cryogenic X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer with a required energy resolution
of 7 eV at 6 keV. Five mechanical coolers are used to cool from ambient
temperature to about 4 K: four two-stage Stirling coolers (STC) driven
nominally at 15 Hz and a Joule-Thomson cooler (JTC) driven nominally at 52 Hz.
In 2019, we operated the flight-model instrument for two weeks, in which we
also obtained accelerometer data inside the cryostat at a low-temperature stage
(He tank). X-ray detector and accelerometer data were obtained continuously
while changing the JTC drive frequency, which produced a unique data set for
investigating how the vibration from the cryocoolers propagates to the
detector. In the detector noise spectra, we observed harmonics of both STCs and
JTC. More interestingly, we also observed the low (<20 Hz) frequency beat
between the 4'th JTC and 14'th STC harmonics and the 7'th JTC and the 23--24'th
STC harmonics. We present here a description and interpretation of these
measurements.

  Resolve is a payload hosting an X-ray microcalorimeter detector operated at
50 mK in the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). It is currently
under development as part of an international collaboration and is planned to
be launched in 2023. A primary technical concern is the micro-vibration
interference in the sensitive microcalorimeter detector caused by the
spacecraft bus components. We conducted a series of verification tests in
2021-2022 on the ground, the results of which are reported here. We defined the
micro-vibration interface between the spacecraft and the Resolve instrument. In
the instrument-level test, the flight-model hardware was tested against the
interface level by injecting it with micro-vibrations and evaluating the
instrument response using the 50 mK stage temperature stability, ADR magnet
current consumption rate, and detector noise spectra. We found strong responses
when injecting micro-vibration at about 200, 380, and 610 Hz. In the former two
cases, the beat between the injected frequency and cryocooler frequency
harmonics were observed in the detector noise spectra. In the spacecraft-level
test, the acceleration and instrument responses were measured with and without
suspension of the entire spacecraft. The reaction wheels (RWs) and inertial
reference units (IRUs), two major sources of micro-vibration among the bus
components, were operated. In conclusion, the observed responses of Resolve are
within the acceptable levels in the nominal operational range of the RWs and
IRUs. There is no evidence that the resultant energy
  resolution degradation is beyond the current allocation of noise budget.

  Because of its proximity and the large size of its black hole, M87 is one of
the best targets for studying the launching mechanism of active galactic
nucleus jets. Currently, magnetic fields are considered to be an essential
factor in the launching and accelerating of the jet. However, current
observational estimates of the magnetic field strength of the M87 jet are
limited to the innermost part of the jet or to HST-1. No attempt has yet been
made to measure the magnetic field strength in between. We aim to infer the
magnetic field strength of the M87 jet out to a distance of several thousand
$r_s$ by tracking the distance-dependent changes in the synchrotron spectrum of
the jet from high-resolution very long baseline interferometry observations. In
order to obtain high-quality spectral index maps, quasi-simultaneous
observations at 22 and 43 GHz were conducted using the KVN and VERA Array
(KaVA) and the VLBA. We compared the spectral index distributions obtained from
the observations with a model and placed limits on the magnetic field strengths
as a function of distance. The overall spectral morphology is broadly
consistent over the course of these observations. The observed synchrotron
spectrum rapidly steepens from $\alpha_{22-43 GHz}$ ~ -0.7 at ~ 2 mas to
$\alpha_{22-43 GHz}$ ~ -2.5 at ~ 6 mas. A spectral index model in which
nonthermal electron injections inside the jet decrease with distance can
adequately reproduce the observed trend. This suggests the magnetic field
strength of the jet at a distance of 2 - 10 mas (~ 900 $r_s$ - ~ 4500 $r_s$ in
the deprojected distance) has a range of $B=(0.3 - 1.0 G)(z/2 mas)^{-0.73}$.
Extrapolating to the EHT scale yields consistent results, suggesting that the
majority of the magnetic flux of the jet near the black hole is preserved out
to ~ 4500 $r_s$ without significant dissipation.

\\
  Scientific Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (sCMOS) sensors are
finding increasingly more applications in astronomical observations, thanks to
their advantages over charge-coupled devices (CCDs) such as a higher readout
frame rate, higher radiation tolerance, and higher working temperature. In this
work, we investigate the performance at the individual pixel level of a
large-format sCMOS sensor, GSENSE1516BSI, which has 4096 * 4096 pixels, each of
15 {\mu}m in size. To achieve this, three areas on the sCMOS sensor, each
consisting of 99 * 99 pixels, are chosen for the experiment. The readout noise,
conversion gain and energy resolutions of the individual pixels in these areas
are measured from a large number (more than 25,000) of X-ray events accumulated
for each of the pixels through long time exposures. The energy resolution of
these pixels can reach 140 eV at 6.4 keV at room temperature and shows a
significant positive correlation with the readout noise. The accurate gain can
also be derived individually for each of the pixels from its X-ray spectrum
obtained. Variations of the gain values are found at a level of 0.56%
statistically among the 30 thousand pixels in the areas studied. With the gain
of each pixel determined accurately, a precise gain correction is performed
pixel by pixel in these areas, in contrast to the standardized ensemble gain
used in the conventional method. In this way, we could almost completely
eliminate the degradation of energy resolutions caused by gain variations among
pixels. As a result, the energy resolution at room temperature can be
significantly improved to 124.6 eV at 4.5 keV and 140.7 eV at 6.4 keV. This
pixel-by-pixel gain correction method can be applied to all kinds of CMOS
sensors, and is expected to find interesting applications in X-ray
spectroscopic observations in the future.

\\
  We analyse optical and X-ray spectroscopy of the Of?p star HD108, known for
its strong dipolar magnetic field and its optical line profile variability with
a timescale of $54 \pm 3$ yrs, interpreted as the stellar rotation period.
Optical emission lines have now recovered from their minimum emission state
reached in 2007 - 2008. The variations of the equivalent width of the H$\alpha$
emission provide constraints on the inclination of the rotation axis ($i$) and
the obliquity of the magnetic axis ($\beta$). The best agreement between model
and observations is found for ($i$, $\beta$) pairs with $i + \beta \simeq
85^{\circ}$ and $i \in [30^{\circ},55^{\circ}]$. The Balmer emission lines
display stochastic variability at the $\sim 5$ % level on timescales of a few
days. TESS photometry unveils transient modulations on similar timescales in
addition to prominent red noise variations. A Chandra X-ray observation of
December 2021, when the star was at a higher emission level, indicates a slight
increase of the flux and a spectral hardening compared to the August 2002
XMM-Newton observation, taken near minimum emission state. Magnetohydrodynamic
simulations are used to compute synthetic X-ray spectra. With our current best
estimate of the $\dot{M}_{B=0}$ mass-loss rate, the simulated X-ray luminosity
and spectral energy distribution agree very well with the observations.
Finally, the radial velocities vary on a period of 8.5 years with a
peak-to-peak amplitude of 10 - 11 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting orbital motion with
an unseen companion of at least 4 M$_{\odot}$.

  Obtaining high-resolution images at centimeter-or-longer wavelengths is vital
for understanding the physics of jets. We reconstructed images from the M87 22
GHz data observed with the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) by using the
regularized maximum likelihood (RML) method, which is different from the
conventional imaging method CLEAN. Consequently, a bright core and jet
extending about 30 mas to the northwest were detected with a higher resolution
than in the CLEAN image. The width of the jet was 0.5 mas at 0.3 mas from the
core, consistent with the width measured in the 86 GHz image in the previous
study. In addition, three ridges were able to be detected at around 8 mas from
the core, even though the peak-to-peak separation was only 1.0 mas. This
indicates that the RML image's spatial resolution is at least 30% higher than
that of the CLEAN image. This study is an important step for future
multi-frequency and high-cadence observations of the EAVN to discuss the more
detailed structure of the jet and its time variability.

  I present a catalog of distances to 63 molecular clouds located within ~2.5
kpc of the Sun. The cloud distances are derived based on utilizing the Gaia DR3
parallaxes of the young stellar objects (YSOs). By identifying AllWISE YSO
candidates (YSOCs) with infrared excesses and combining them with published
YSOC catalogs, I compile an all-sky YSOC sample that is devoid of a significant
proportion of contaminants. Using Gaia DR3 astrometric measurements, I
associate over 3000 YSOCs with 63 local clouds and obtain the average distance
to each cloud by fitting the YSOC parallax distribution within the cloud. I
find good agreements with typical scatter of <10% between my new cloud
distances and previous distance estimates. Unlike cloud distances obtained
using stellar extinction, my catalog provides distances to the relatively dense
areas of local clouds, which makes them more appropriate references for
investigating the physical properties of nearby dense regions.

  Understanding the natal kicks received by neutron stars (NSs) during
formation is a critical component of modelling the evolution of massive
binaries. Natal kicks are an integral input parameter for population synthesis
codes, and have implications for the formation of double NS systems and their
subsequent merger rates. However, many of the standard observational kick
distributions that are used are obtained from samples created only from
isolated NSs. Kick distributions derived in this way overestimate the intrinsic
NS kick distribution. For NSs in binaries, we can only directly estimate the
effect of the natal kick on the binary system, instead of the natal kick
received by the NS itself. Here, for the first time, we present a binary kick
distribution for NSs with low-mass companions. We compile a catalogue of 145
NSs in low-mass binaries with the best available constraints on proper motion,
distance, and systemic radial velocity. For each binary, we use a
three-dimensional approach to estimate its binary kick. We discuss the
implications of these kicks on system formation, and provide a parametric model
for the overall binary kick distribution, for use in future theoretical
modelling work. We compare our results with other work on isolated NSs and NSs
in binaries, finding that the NS kick distributions fit using only isolated
pulsars underestimate the fraction of NSs that receive low kicks. We discuss
the implications of our results on modelling double NS systems, and provide
suggestions on how to use our results in future theoretical works.

Title: Small-scale dynamo with finite correlation times
Authors: Yann Carteret, Dominik Schleicher and Jennifer Schober
Categories: astro-ph.GA physics.plasm-ph
\\
  Fluctuation dynamos occur in most turbulent plasmas in astrophysics and are
the prime candidates for amplifying and maintaining cosmic magnetic fields. A
few analytical models exist to describe their behaviour but they are based on
simplifying assumptions. For instance the well-known Kazantsev model assumes an
incompressible flow that is delta-correlated in time. However, these
assumptions can break down in the interstellar medium as it is highly
compressible and the velocity field has a finite correlation time. Using the
renewing flow method developed by Bhat and Subramanian (2014), we aim to extend
Kazantsev's results to a more general class of turbulent flows. The cumulative
effect of both compressibility and finite correlation time over the Kazantsev
spectrum is studied analytically. We derive an equation for the longitudinal
two-point magnetic correlation function in real space to first order in the
correlation time $\tau$ and for an arbitrary degree of compressibility (DOC).
This generalised Kazantsev equation encapsulates the original Kazantsev
equation. In the limit of small Strouhal numbers $St \propto \tau$ we use the
WKB approximation to derive the growth rate and scaling of the magnetic power
spectrum. We find the result that the Kazantsev spectrum is preserved, i.e.
$M_k(k)\sim k^{3/2}$. The growth rate is also negligibly affected by the finite

  Analysis of bulk meteorite compositions has revealed small isotopic
variations due to the presence of material (e.g., stardust) that preserved the
signature of nuclear reactions occurring in specific stellar sites. The
interpretation of such anomalies provides evidence for the environment of the
birth of the Sun, its accretion process, the evolution of the solar
proto-planetary disk, and the formation of the planets. A crucial element of
such interpretation is the comparison of the observed anomalies to predictions
from models of stellar nucleosynthesis. To date, however, this comparison has
been limited to a handful of model predictions. This is mostly because the
calculated stellar abundances need to be transformed into a specific
representation, which nuclear astrophysicists and stellar nucleosynthesis
researchers are not familiar with. Here, we show in detail that this
representation is needed to account for mass fractionation effects in meteorite
data that can be generated both in nature and during instrumental analysis. We
explain the required internal normalisation to a selected isotopic ratio,
describe the motivations behind such representation more widely, and provide
the tools to perform the calculations. Then, we present some examples
considering two elements produced by the $slow$ neutron-capture ($s$) process:
Sr and Mo. We show which specific representations for the Sr isotopic
composition calculated by $s$-process models better disentangle the
nucleosynthetic signatures from stars of different metallicity. For Mo, the
comparison between data and models is improved due to a recent re-analysis of
the $^{95}$Mo neutron-capture cross section.

\\
  Recent VLBI monitoring has found transverse motions of the M87 jet. However,
due to the limited cadence of previous observations, details of the transverse
motion have not been fully revealed yet. We have regularly monitored the M87
jet at KVN and VERA Array (KaVA) 22 GHz from December 2013 to June 2016. The
average time interval of the observation is ~ 0.1 year, which is suitable for
tracking short-term structural changes. From these observations, the M87 jet is
well represented by double ridge lines in the region 2 - 12 mas from the core.
We found that the ridge lines exhibit transverse oscillations in all observed
regions with an average period of $0.94\pm0.12$ years. When the sinusoidal fit
is performed, we found that the amplitude of this oscillation is an order of
$\sim0.1$ mas, and the oscillations in the northern and southern limbs are
almost in phase. Considering the amplitude, it does not originate from Earth's
parallax. We propose possible scenarios of the transverse oscillation, such as
the propagation of jet instabilities or magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or
perturbed mass injection around magnetically dominated accretion flows.

  We combine the superior JWST/NIRCam imaging and MUSE data to characterize the
properties of galaxies in different environmental conditions in the cluster
Abell2744 (z=0.3064) and in its immediate surroundings. Our most striking
result is the discovery of a ``red-excess'' population in F200W-F444W colors
both in the cluster regions and the field. These galaxies have normal
F115W-F150W colors, but are up to 0.8 mag redder than red sequence galaxies in
F200W-F444W. They also have rather blue rest frame B-V colors. Galaxies with
the largest color deviations are found in the field and at the cluster virial
radius, suggesting that mechanisms taking place in these regions might be more
effective in producing these colors. Looking at their morphology, many cluster
galaxies show signatures consistent with ram pressure stripping, while field
galaxies have features resembling interactions and mergers. Our hypothesis is
that these galaxies are characterized by dust enshrouded star formation: a
JWST/NIRSpec spectrum for one of the galaxies is dominated by a strong PAH at
3.3mu m, suggestive of dust obscured star formation. Larger spectroscopic
samples are needed to understand if the color excess is due exclusively to
dust-obscured star formation, and the role of environment in triggering it.

Title: Observed UV continuum slopes ($\beta$) of galaxies at $z = 0.40-0.75$ in
  the GOODS-north field

\\
  We estimate the UV continuum slope ($\beta$) of 465 galaxies (with
luminosities of 0.028 $-$ 3.3 $L^{*}_{z=0.5}$) in the Great Observatories
Origins Survey (GOODS) Northern field in the redshift range $z=0.40 - 0.75$. We
use two AstroSat/UVIT (N242W, N245M), two HST (F275W, F336W), and a KPNO (U)
bands to sample the UV continuum slope of selected galaxies between 1215 and
2600 angstrom. The mean (median) and 1$\sigma$ scatter in the observed $\beta$
are found to be $-1.33\pm0.07~(-1.32)$ and 0.60 within the considered redshift
range. We do not find any significant evolution in the mean $\beta$ within our
redshift window. Our measurements add new data points to the global $\beta$ -
$z$ relation in the least-explored redshift regime, further reinforcing the
gradual reddening of galaxy UV continuum with cosmic time. We notice no strong
consistent trend between $\beta$ and M$_{1500}$ for the entire luminosity range
$-21$ $< M_{1500} <-15$ mag. Although, the majority of the most luminous
galaxies (M$_{1500} <-19$ mag) are found to have relatively redder slopes.
Using UVIT, we detect galaxies as faint as M$_{1500} = -15.6$ mag (i.e., 0.028
$L^{*}_{z=0.5}$). The faintest galaxies (M$_{1500} > -16$ mag) tend to be
redder, which indicates they were less actively forming stars during this
cosmic time interval. Our study highlights the unique capability of UVIT
near-UV imaging to characterize the rest-frame far-UV properties of galaxies at
redshift $z \sim 0.5$.

Title: No evidence for absence of solar dynamo synchronization
Authors: F. Stefani, J. Beer, T. Weier
Categories: astro-ph.SR astro-ph.EP
Comments: 8 pages, 7 figures
\\
  Context: The old question of whether the solar dynamo is synchronized by the
tidal forces of the orbiting planets has recently received renewed interest,
both from the viewpoint of historical data analysis and in terms of theoretical
and numerical modelling. Aims: We aim to contribute to the solution of this
longstanding puzzle by analyzing cosmogenic radionuclide data from the last
millennium. Methods: We reconsider a recent time-series of $^{14}$C-inferred
sunspot data and compare the resulting cycle minima and maxima with the
corresponding conventional series down to 1610 A.D., enhanced by Schove's data
before that time. Results: We find that, despite recent claims to the contrary,
the $^{14}$C-inferred sunspot data are well compatible with a synchronized
solar dynamo, exhibiting a relatively phase-stable period of 11.07 years, which
points to a synchronizing role of the spring tides of the Venus-Earth-Jupiter
system.

  How black holes consume and eject matter has been the subject of intense
studies for more than 60 years. The luminosity of these systems are often
compared to the Eddington limit, the border at which the spherical accretion is
inhibited by the radiation pressure of photons it produces. The discovery of
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) showed that accretion can proceed even when
the apparent luminosity exceeds the Eddington limit (Kaaret et al. 2017). High
apparent luminosity might be produced by the beaming of the incident radiation
by a thick collimated outflow or by a truly super-Eddington accretion flow.
However, possibilities to study these outflows in detail are limited, as ULXs
are typically found in distant galaxies. Using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry
Explorer (IXPE, Weisskopf et al. 2022), we made the first measurement of X-ray
polarization in Galactic X-ray binary Cyg X-3. The detection of high,
$\approx$25\%, nearly energy-independent linear polarization, orthogonal to the
direction of the radio ejections, unambiguously indicates the primary source is
obscured and the observer on Earth only sees reflected and scattered light.
Modelling shows there is an optically thick envelope with a narrow funnel
around the primary X-ray source in the system. We derive an upper limit on the
opening angle of the funnel that implies a lower limit on the beamed luminosity
exceeding the Eddington value. We show that Cyg X-3 is viewed as a ULX to an
extragalactic observer located along the axis of the funnel. Our findings
reveal this unique persistent source as an ideal laboratory for the study of
the inner workings of ULX central engines.

  Measurements of the growth rate of structures at $z < 0.1$ with peculiar
velocity surveys have the potential of testing the validity of general
relativity on cosmic scales. In this work, we present growth-rate measurements
from realistic simulated sets of type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF). We describe our simulation methodology, the
light-curve fitting and peculiar velocity estimation. Using the maximum
likelihood method, we derive constraints on $f\sigma_8$ using only ZTF SN Ia
peculiar velocities. We carefully tested the method and we quantified biases
due to selection effects (photometric detection, spectroscopic follow-up for
typing) on several independent realizations. We simulated the equivalent of 6
years of ZTF data, and considering an unbiased spectroscopically typed sample
at $z < 0.06$, we obtained unbiased estimates of $f\sigma_8$ with an average
uncertainty of 19% precision. We also investigated the information gain in
applying bias correction methods. Our results validate our framework which can
be used on real ZTF data.

  GRB 221009A is the brightest gamma-ray burst ever detected since the
discovery of this kind of energetic explosions. However, an accurate
measurement of the prompt emission properties of this burst is very challenging
due to its exceptional brightness. With joint observations of
\textit{Insight}-HXMT and GECAM-C, we made an unprecedentedly accurate
measurement of the emission during the first $\sim$1800 s of GRB 221009A,
including its precursor, main emission (ME, which dominates the burst in flux),
flaring emission and early afterglow, in the hard X-ray to soft gamma-ray band
from $\sim$ 10 keV to $\sim$ 6 MeV. Based on the GECAM-C unsaturated data of
the ME, we measure a record-breaking isotropic equivalent energy ($E_{\rm
iso}$) of $\bf \sim 1.5 \times 10^{55}$ erg, which is about eight times the
total rest-mass energy of the Sun. The early afterglow data require a
significant jet break between 650 s and 1100 s, most likely at $\sim950$ s from
the afterglow starting time $T_{AG}$, which corresponds to a jet opening angle
of $\sim {0.7^\circ} \ (\eta_\gamma n)^{1/8}$, where $n$ is the ambient medium
density in units of $\rm cm^{-3}$ and $\eta_\gamma$ is the ratio between
$\gamma$-ray energy and afterglow kinetic energy. The beaming-corrected total
$\gamma$-ray energy $E_{\gamma}$ is $\sim 1.15 \times10^{51} \ (\eta_\gamma
n)^{1/4}$ erg, which is typical for long GRBs. These results suggest that this
GRB may have a special central engine, which could launch and collimate a very
narrowly beamed jet with an ordinary energy budget, leading to exceptionally
luminous gamma-ray radiation per unit solid angle. Alternatively, more GRBs
might have such a narrow and bright beam, which are missed by an unfavorable
viewing angle or have been detected without distance measurement.

  We review the surface flux transport model for the evolution of magnetic flux
patterns on the Sun's surface. Our underlying motivation is to understand the
model's prediction of the polar field (or axial dipole) strength at the end of
the solar cycle. The main focus is on the "classical" model: namely, steady
axisymmetric profiles for differential rotation and meridional flow, and
uniform supergranular diffusion. Nevertheless, the review concentrates on
recent advances, notably in understanding the roles of transport parameters and
- in particular - the source term. We also discuss the physical justification
for the surface flux transport model, along with efforts to incorporate radial
diffusion, and conclude by summarizing the main directions where researchers
have moved beyond the classical model.

Title: Excitation of Langmuir waves in the magnetospheres of AGN
Authors: Z.N. Osmanov
Categories: astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE physics.plasm-ph
Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures
\\
  In the paper we study the process of excitation of Langmuir waves in the
magnetospheres of active galactic nuclei (AGN), by taking a
general-relativistic expression of the Goldreich-Julian density into account.
We considered the linearised set of equations which describe dynamics of the
studied mechanism: the Euler equation, the continuity equation and the Poisson
equation. After solving the dispersion relation and obtaining the instability
growth rate, we explored it versus several physical parameters: electron's and
proton's relativistic factors and the mass and luminosity of AGN, which are
supposed to be Kerr black holes. We showed that the parametric process of
energy pumping into the Langmuir waves is very efficient and the electrostatic
field's amplitude will be exponentially amplifying, which might account for
pair creation, particle acceleration and plasma heating processes in the nearby
regions of AGN.

Title: Statistical analysis of the total magnetic flux decay rate in solar
  active regions
Authors: Andrei A. Plotnikov, Valentina I. Abramenko, Alexander S. Kutsenko
Categories: astro-ph.SR
\\
  We used line-of-sight magnetograms acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory to derive the decay rate of
total unsigned magnetic flux for 910 ephemeral and active regions (ARs)
observed between 2010 and 2017. We found that: i) most of the ARs obey the
power law dependence between the peak magnetic flux and the magnetic flux decay
rate, $DR$, so that $DR\sim \Phi^{0.70}$; ii) larger ARs lose smaller fraction
of their magnetic flux per unit of time than the smaller ARs; iii) there exists
a cluster of ARs exhibiting significantly lower decay rate than it would follow
from the power law and all of them are unipolar sunspots with total fluxes in
the narrow range of $(2 - 8) \times 10^{21}$ Mx; iv) a comparison with our
previous results shows that the emergence rate is always higher than the decay
rate. The emergence rate follows a power law with a shallower slope than the
slope of the decay-rate power law. The results allowed us to suggest that not
only the maximum total magnetic flux determines the character of the decaying
regime of the AR, some of the ARs end up as a slowly decaying unipolar sunspot;
there should be certain physical mechanisms to stabilize such a sunspot.

  Systematic Surveys

Categories: astro-ph.EP
Comments: 21 pages, 10 figure, 1 table. Accepted for publication in Icarus
\\
  The apparent magnitude of elongated small bodies is time-dependent over their
rotation phase. Therefore, previously undiscovered aspherical minor planets may
experience a shape-driven selection effect in systematic surveys versus their
spherical counterparts. In this study, we conduct injection-recovery exercises
of synthetic asteroid lightcurves using a simple model to quantify the effect
of varying axial ratio on detection efficiencies. We find that high-amplitude
lightcurves are confronted with adverse selection effects for survey cadences
and discovery thresholds for constructing tracklets that are representative of
modern and proposed future NEO searches. Furthermore, we illustrate the
possible hazards of drawing population-level inferences on an underlying
reservoir of elongated small bodies. If physical size and characteristic axial
ratios are correlated, then size-frequency distributions may require revision
at small diameters. In particular, this effect could alter the estimated
populations of near-Earth objects. We conclude by discussing the applicability
of our results to various other classes of solar system minor planets and
interstellar interlopers, as well as discuss future work that may further
interrogate this detection bias.

  J1348--630
Authors: Andrzej A. Zdziarski, Marek Sikora, Michal Szanecki and Markus
  Boettcher
Categories: astro-ph.HE
Comments: submitted to ApJ
\\
  We model interaction with the surrounding medium of the main discrete jet
ejection in the accreting black-hole binary MAXI J1348--630. The kinetic energy
in the ejection of that jet was estimated before to be $>10^{46}$ erg. That
energy requires that the jet power was about two orders of magnitude above the
limit corresponding to a magnetically arrested accretion onto a maximally
rotating black hole. That estimate was obtained by considering the initial
ballistic jet propagation in a surrounding cavity followed by a sudden
deceleration in the interstellar medium under the assumption of its standard
density of $\sim$1 cm$^{-3}$. Such densities are likely in the surrounding of
this source given its location in the Galactic Plane. Here, we show that the
estimate of the kinetic energy can be reduced to realistic values of $\sim\!
10^{44}$ erg by considering the presence of a transition layer with an
exponential density growth separating the cavity and the interstellar medium.
In that case, the jet is found to decelerate mostly in the transition layer, in
regions with the densities $\ll$1 cm$^{-3}$, which strongly reduces the energy
requirement. Still, the required jet masses are large, ruling out the presence
of a significant number of electron-positron pairs.

channelization of multi-tonal signals, typically used for the read-out of
cryogenic sensors which are multiplexed in the frequency domain (FDM), by means
of Microwave Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) Multiplexer
($\mu$MUX). We demonstrate how implementing a bank of many of these filters,
can be used to perform a channelization of the multi-tonal input signal to
retrieve the data added by the sensors. We show how this approach can be
implemented in a resource-efficient manner in a Field Programmable Gate Array
(FPGA) within the state-of-the-art, which allows great scalability for reading
thousands of sensors; as is required by Radio Telescopes in Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation (CMB) surveys using cryogenic bolometers, particles

  We have performed a detailed spectral analysis of the helium-rich hot
subdwarf EC 20187-4939 using data obtained in the SALT survey of helium-rich
hot subdwarfs. We have measured its effective temperature, surface gravity and
chemical abundances from the spectrum. Its radius has also been determined by
fitting the spectral energy distribution using photometric data, from which a
mass of 0.44 Msun has been inferred using the measurement of surface gravity.
This star is particularly abundant in helium and nitrogen, whilst being both
carbon and oxygen-weak. The surface abundances and mass have been found to be
consistent with a helium white dwarf merger product. The abundance effects of
alpha captures on nitrogen during the merger process and possible connections
between EC 20187-4939 and other carbon-weak related objects are discussed.

Title: Raising the observed metallicity floor with a 3D non-LTE analysis of

  Context: The first stars produced the first heavy elements and set the stage
for the formation of the first galaxies. Accurate chemical abundances of ultra
metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-4) can be used to infer properties of the first
stars, and thus the formation mechanism for low-mass second generation stars in
the early universe. Spectroscopic studies have shown that most second
generation stars are carbon-enhanced with one notable exception SDSS
J102915.14+172927.9. Aims: We reanalyse the composition of SDSS
J102915.14+172927.9. Methods: We developed a tailored 3D model atmosphere for
SDSS J102915.14+172927.9 with the Stagger-code, making use of an improved
surface gravity estimate based on the Gaia DR3 parallax. This model was used as
input in the radiative transfer code Balder to compute 3D non-LTE synthetic
spectra. These spectra were then used to infer abundances for Mg, Si, Ca, Fe
and Ni, and upper limits on Li, Na and Al. 3D LTE synthetic spectra were
computed with Scate to infer the abundance of Ti and upper limits on C and N.
Results: In contrast to earlier works based on 1D non-LTE corrections to 3D LTE
results, we are able to achieve ionisation balance for Ca I and Ca II when
employing our consistent 3D non-LTE treatment. Moreover, the elemental
abundances are systematically higher than those found in earlier works. In
particular, [Fe/H] increases by 0.57 dex, and the upper limits of C and N
increase by 0.90 dex and 1.82 dex, respectively. Conclusions: We find that
Population III progenitors with masses 10-20 M_sun exploding with energy
E<=3*10^{51} erg can reproduce our 3D non-LTE abundance pattern. Contrary to
previous work, we obtain higher upper limits on the carbon abundance that are
``marginally consistent'' with star formation through atomic line cooling, and
as such, prevent strong conclusions about the formation mechanism of this low
mass star.

  Central Compact Objects (CCOs) are neutron stars found close to the centers
of some supernova remnants. Some of them are presumably covered by carbon
envelopes. Their unpulsed thermal X-ray emission can originate either from the
entire surface covered by a carbon atmosphere or a non-uniformly emitting
hydrogen atmosphere as an alternative. However, the latter scenario appears
unlikely given the available upper limits on the amplitude of pulsations. Here
we explore a possibility to further discriminate between the two scenarios
using X-ray polarimetric observations. We compute the polarization degree (PD)
for non-magnetized pure carbon and pure hydrogen atmospheres with effective
temperatures between 1 and 6 MK and find that it can reach up to 25% and 40%
for hydrogen and carbon atmospheres, respectively, in the photon energy band
1-10 keV. However, given the available constraints on possible inhomogeneities
of the temperature distribution deduced from modeling of the X-ray spectrum of
the CCO in HESS J1731-347, the integrated PD appears to be very low both for
carbon (<0.25%) and hydrogen (a few %) compositions in the energy band of 2-8
keV covered by the recently launched Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. We
conclude, therefore, that polarization from CCOs is not expected to be
detectable by current facilities, but future detection would strongly support
non-uniform hydrogen composition models.

Title: Roll Angle Adjustment Dims Starlink Satellites
Authors: Anthony Mallama and Jay Respler
Categories: astro-ph.IM
\\
  The brightness of Starlink satellites during orbit parking and orbit raising
decreased significantly in 2020 when the operator modified their orientation.
The mean apparent magnitude before the change was 3.90 +/- 0.18, while
afterward it was 5.69 +/- 0.06. When magnitudes are adjusted to a standard
distance of 1,000 km the means are 4.86 +/- 0.16 and 7.31 +/- 0.05. The
difference at the standard distance indicates that spacecraft with adjusted
roll angles are 90% fainter on average than the earlier ones.

Title: Radio detections of two unusual cataclysmic variables in the VLA Sky
  Survey

\\
  We report two new radio detections of cataclysmic variables (CVs), and place
them in context with radio and X-ray detections of other CVs. We detected QS
Vir, a low accretion-rate CV; V2400 Oph, a diskless intermediate polar (IP);
and recovered the polar AM Her in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) 2-4
GHz radio images. The radio luminosities of these systems are higher than
typically expected from coronal emission from stars of similar spectral types,
and neither system is expected to produce jets, leaving the origin of the radio
emission a puzzle. The radio emission mechanism for these two CVs may be
electron-cyclotron maser emission, synchrotron radiation, or a more exotic
process. We compile published radio detections of CVs, and X-ray measurements
of these CVs, to illustrate their locations in the radio - X-ray luminosity
plane, a diagnostic tool often used for X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei,
and radio stars. Several radio-emitting CVs, including these two newly detected
CVs, seem to lie near the principal radio/X-ray track followed by black hole
X-ray binaries (BHXBs) at low luminosity, suggesting additional complexity in
classifying unknown systems using their radio and X-ray luminosities alone.

Title: Near-infrared Polarization Charateristics of the Zodiacal Light Observed
  with DIRBE/COBE
Authors: Kohji Takimoto, Shuji Matsuura, Kei Sano, and Richard M. Feder
Categories: astro-ph.EP
Comments: 11 pages, 12 figures, accepted by ApJ
\\
  We report near-infrared polarization of the zodiacal light (ZL) measured from
space by the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) on board the Cosmic
Background Explorer in photometric bands centered at 1.25, 2.2, and 3.5 $\mu$m.
To constrain the physical properties of interplanetary dust (IPD), we use DIRBE
Weekly Sky Maps to investigate the solar elongation ($\epsilon$), ecliptic
latitude ($\beta$), and wavelength ($\lambda$) dependence of ZL polarization.
We find that the polarization of the ZL varies as a function of $\epsilon$ and
$\beta$, consistent with observed polarization at $\lambda$ = 550 nm. While the
polarization dependence with wavelength at $(\epsilon$, $\beta)=(90^{\circ}$,
$0^{\circ})$ is modest (increasing from 17.7 $\pm$ 0.2% at 1.25 $\mu$m to 21.0
$\pm$ 0.3% at 3.5 $\mu$m), the variation is more pronounced at the North
Ecliptic Pole (23.1 $\pm$ 1.6, 35.1 $\pm$ 2.0 and 39.3 $\pm$ 2.1% at 1.25, 2.2
and 3.5 $\mu$m, respectively). The variation of ZL polarization with wavelength
is not explained by either Rayleigh scattering or by absorptive particles
larger than 10 $\mu$m.

Title: VARAHA: A Fast Non-Markovian sampler for estimating Gravitational-Wave
  posteriors
Authors: Vaibhav Tiwari, Charlie Hoy, Stephen Fairhurst and Duncan MacLeod
Categories: astro-ph.HE
\\
  This article introduces VARAHA, an open-source, fast, non-Markovian sampler
for estimating gravitational-wave posteriors. VARAHA differs from existing
Nested sampling algorithms by gradually discarding regions of low likelihood,
rather than gradually sampling regions of high likelihood. This alternative
mindset enables VARAHA to freely draw samples from anywhere within the
high-likelihood region of the parameter space, allowing for analyses to
complete in significantly fewer cycles. This means that VARAHA can
significantly reduce both the wall and CPU time of all analyses. VARAHA offers
many benefits, particularly for gravitational-wave astronomy where Bayesian
inference can take many days, if not weeks, to complete. For instance, VARAHA
can be used to estimate accurate sky locations, astrophysical probabilities and
source classifications within minutes, which is particularly useful for
multi-messenger follow-up of binary neutron star observations; VARAHA localises
GW170817 $\sim 30$ times faster than LALInference. Although only aligned-spin,
dominant multipole waveform models can be used for gravitational-wave analyses,
it is trivial to extend this algorithm to include additional physics without
hindering performance. We envision VARAHA being used for gravitational-wave
studies, particularly estimating parameters using expensive waveform models,
analysing subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates, generating simulated data
for population studies, and rapid posterior estimation for binary neutron star
mergers.

Title: Detailed shapes of the line-of-sight velocity distributions in massive
  early-type galaxies from non-parametric spectral models
Authors: Kianusch Mehrgan, Jens Thomas, Roberto Saglia, Taniya Parikh and Ralf
  Bender
Categories: astro-ph.GA
Comments: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal
\\
  We present the first systematic study of the detailed shapes of the
line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs) in nine massive early-type
galaxies (ETGs) using the novel non-parametric modelling code WINGFIT.
High-signal spectral observations with MUSE at the VLT allow us to measure
between 40 and 400 individual LOSVDs in each galaxy at a signal-to-noise level
better than 100 per spectral bin and to trace the LOSVDs all the way out to the
highest stellar velocities. We extensively discuss potential LOSVD distortions
due to template mismatch and strategies to avoid them. Our analysis uncovers a
plethora of complex, large scale kinematic structures for the shapes of the
LOSVDs. Most notably, in the centers of all ETGs in our sample, we detect
faint, broad LOSVD ``wings'' extending the line-of-sight velocities, v_los,
well beyond 3 sigma to v_los = +- 1000 - 1500 km/s on both sides of the peak of
the LOSVDs. These wings likely originate from PSF effects and contain velocity
information about the very central unresolved regions of the galaxies. In
several galaxies, we detect wings of similar shape also towards the outer parts
of the MUSE field-of-view. We propose that these wings originate from faint
halos of loosely bound stars around the ETGs, similar to the cluster-bound
stellar envelopes found around many brightest cluster galaxies.

Title: Robustness Measures for Molecular Detections using High-Resolution
  Transmission Spectroscopy of Exoplanets
Authors: Connor J. Cheverall, Nikku Madhusudhan, M{\aa}ns Holmberg
Categories: astro-ph.EP
Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
\\
  Ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy has emerged as a
promising technique for detecting chemicals in transiting exoplanetary
atmospheres. Despite chemical inferences in several exoplanets and previous
robustness studies, a robust and consistent detrending method to remove
telluric and stellar features from transmission spectra has yet to be agreed
upon. In this work we investigate the robustness of metrics used to optimise
PCA-based detrending for high-resolution transmission spectra of exoplanets in
the near-infrared. As a case study, we consider observations of the hot Jupiter
HD 189733 b obtained using the CARMENES spectrograph on the 3.5 m CAHA
telescope. We confirm that optimising the detrending parameters to maximise the
S/N of a cross-correlation signal in the presence of noise has the potential to
bias the detection significance at the planetary velocity of optimisation.
However, we find that optimisation using the difference between a
signal-injected cross-correlation function and the direct cross-correlation
function (CCF) is more robust against over-optimisation of noise and spurious
signals. We additionally examine the robustness of weighting the contribution
of each order to the final CCF, and of S/N calculations. Using a prescribed
robust methodology, we confirm H2O in the atmosphere of HD 189733 b (S/N =
6.1). We then investigate two further case studies, of exoplanets HD 209458 b
and WASP-76 b, confirming OH in the atmosphere of WASP-76 b (S/N = 4.7), and
demonstrating how non-robust methods may induce false positive or inflated
detections. Our findings pave the way towards a robust framework for
homogeneous characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres using high-resolution
transmission spectroscopy in the near-infrared.

Title: One EURO for Uranus: the Elliptical Uranian Relativity Orbiter mission

  Recent years have seen an increasing interest in sending a mission to Uranus,
visited so far only by Voyager 2 in 1986. EURO (Elliptical Uranian Relativity
Orbiter) is a preliminary mission concept investigating the possibility of
dynamically measuring the planet's angular momentum ${\boldsymbol S}$ by means
of the Lense-Thirring effect affecting a putative Uranian orbiter. It is
possible, at least in principle, to separate the relativistic precessions of
the orbital inclination $I$ to the Celestial Equator and of the longitude of
the ascending node $\Omega$ of the spacecraft from its classical rates of the
pericentre $\omega$ induced by the multipoles $J_\ell,\,\ell=2,\,3,\,4,\ldots$
of the planet's gravity field by adopting an orbital plane containing the
planet's spin axis $\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$, perpendicular to the Celestial
Equator, and whose position in the latter is the same as of the projection of
$\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$ on to it. For a wide and elliptical $2\,000\times
100\,000\,\mathrm{km}$ orbit, the gravitomagnetic signatures amount to tens of
milliarcseconds per year, while, for a suitable choice of the initial
conditions, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the range-rate shift can reach the
level of $\simeq 1.5\times 10^{-3}$ millimetre per second in a single
pericentre passage of a few hours. By lowering the apocentre height to
$10\,000\,\mathrm{km}$, the Lense-Thirring precessions are enhanced to the
level of hundreds of milliarcseconds per year. The uncertainties in the
orientation of $\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$ and in $I$ are major sources of
systematic bias; it turns out that they should be determined with accuracies as
good as $\simeq 0.1-1$ and $\simeq 1-10$ milliarcseconds, respectively.

  Surface waves on Earth's magnetopause have a controlling effect upon global
magnetospheric dynamics. Since spacecraft provide sparse in situ observation
points, remote sensing these modes using ground-based instruments in the polar
regions is desirable. However, many open conceptual questions on the expected
signatures remain. Therefore, we provide predictions of key qualitative
features expected in auroral, ionospheric, and ground magnetic observations
through both magnetohydrodynamic theory and a global coupled
magnetosphere-ionosphere simulation of a magnetopause surface eigenmode. These
show monochromatic oscillatory field-aligned currents, due to both the surface
mode and its non-resonant Alfv\'en coupling, are present throughout the
magnetosphere. The currents peak in amplitude at the equatorward edge of the
magnetopause boundary layer, not the open-closed boundary as previously
thought. They also exhibit slow poleward phase motion rather than being purely
evanescent. We suggest the upward field-aligned current perturbations may
result in periodic auroral brightenings. In the ionosphere, convection vortices
circulate the poleward moving field-aligned current structures. Finally,
surface mode signals are predicted in the ground magnetic field, with
ionospheric Hall currents rotating perturbations by approximately (but not
exactly) 90{\deg} compared to the magnetosphere. Thus typical dayside
magnetopause surface modes should be strongest in the East-West ground magnetic
field component. Overall, all ground-based signatures of the magnetopause
surface mode are predicted to have the same frequency across L-shells,
amplitudes that maximise near the magnetopause's equatorward edge, and larger
latitudinal scales than for field line resonance. Implications in terms of
ionospheric Joule heating and geomagnetically induced currents are discussed.

  One of the fundamental open questions in space and astrophysical plasmas is
the nature of turbulence at the smallest, electron scales. This problem is
closely related to the presence of coherent structures such as current sheets,
that were shown to be formed out of this turbulence. The properties of
turbulence and associated current sheets have been investigated with a large
variety of plasma models. However, the effects of the electron inertia on those
processes have not been properly analyzed so far, especially in a
three-dimensional (3D) geometry. We investigate this problem by carrying out 3D
hybrid-kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of decaying turbulence with
our CHIEF code. The main distinguishing feature of this code is an
implementation of the electron inertia without approximations. We find that the
electron inertia plays a critical role in regulating and limiting the largest
values of current density in both real and wavenumber Fourier space, in
particular near and, unexpectedly, even above electron scales. In addition, a
comparison of current sheets formed in 2D vs 3D turbulence reveal that the
latter tend to have smaller values of current density, in particular near
electron scales. The electron inertia is thus of fundamental importance to
accurately describe the nature of plasma turbulence and current-sheet
properties near electron scales.

Title: Eccentricity-tide coupling: impact on binary neutron stars and extreme
  mass-ratio inspirals
Authors: John Paul Bernaldez and Sayak Datta
Categories: gr-qc astro-ph.HE
\\
  We study the effect of tidal interaction between two compact bodies in an
eccentric orbit. We assume the tidal fields to be static. Therefore, we ignore
the dynamic tides and resonant excitations. Using the results, we find the
analytical expression for the phase shift of the emitted gravitational wave. In
the process, we find that in the leading order, the initial eccentricity $e_0$
and the dimensionless tidal deformability $\Lambda$ couple as $\sim
e_0^n\Lambda$, where $n$ is a positive number. We only focus on the dominant
contribution, i.e., $e_0^2\Lambda$. We also compute the accumulated dephasing
for binary neutron star systems. We find that for optimistic values of
eccentricities $e_0 \sim .05$ and $\Lambda \sim 600$, the accumulated dephasing
is $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ radian, requiring a signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 7000$
to be observable. Therefore, these effects can be measured in binary neutron
star systems with large eccentricities if the signal-to-noise ratios of the
systems are also very large. Hence, in third-generation detectors, it may have
an observable impact if the systems have large eccentricities. We also explore
the impact of this effect on extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We find that
even for supermassive bodies with small values of $\Lambda \sim 10^{-3}$, this
effect has large dephasing in EMRIs $\sim \mathcal{O}(10)$ radian. Therefore,
this effect will help in probing the nature of the supermassive bodies in an
EMRI.
