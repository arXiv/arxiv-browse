Title: Nucleosynthesis in outflows of compact objects and detection prospects
  of associated kilonovae
Authors: Nick Ekanger, Mukul Bhattacharya, Shunsaku Horiuchi

  We perform a comparative analysis of nucleosynthesis yields from binary
neutron star (BNS) mergers, black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers, and
core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with the goal of determining which are the
most dominant sources of r-process enrichment observed in stars. We find that
BNS and BHNS binaries may eject similar mass distributions of robust r-process
nuclei post merger (up to 3rd peak and actinides, $A\sim200-240$), after
accounting for the volumetric event rates. Magnetorotational (MR) CCSNe likely
undergo a weak r-process (up to $A\sim140$) and contribute to the production of
light element primary process (LEPP) nuclei, whereas typical thermal,
neutrino-driven CCSNe only synthesize up to 1st r-process peak nuclei
($A\sim80-90$). We also find that the upper limit to the rate of MR CCSNe is
$\lesssim1\%$ the rate of typical thermal CCSNe; if the rate was higher, then
weak r-process nuclei would be overproduced. Although the largest uncertainty
is from the volumetric event rate, the prospects are encouraging for confirming
these rates in the next few years with upcoming surveys. Using a simple model
to estimate the resulting kilonova light curve from mergers and our set of
fiducial merger parameters, we predict that $\sim7$ BNS and $\sim2$ BHNS events
will be detectable per year by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST), with prior
gravitational wave (GW) triggers.

  The brightest Gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A, has spurred numerous theoretical
investigations, with particular attention paid to the origins of ultra-high
energy TeV photons during the prompt phase. However, analyzing the mechanism of
radiation of photons in the $\sim$MeV range has been difficult because the high
flux causes pile-up and saturation effects in most GRB detectors. In this
letter, we present systematic modeling of the time-resolved spectra of the GRB
using unsaturated data obtained from Fermi/GBM (precursor) and
SATech-01/GECAM-C (main emission and flare). Our approach incorporates the
synchrotron radiation model, which assumes an expanding emission region with
relativistic speed and a global magnetic field that decays with radius, and
successfully fits such a model to the observational data. Our results indicate
that the spectra of the burst are fully in accordance with a synchrotron origin
from relativistic electrons accelerated at a large emission radius. The lack of
thermal emission in the prompt emission spectra supports a
Poynting-flux-dominated jet composition.

  Because of its proximity and the large size of its black hole, M87 is one of
the best targets for studying the launching mechanism of active galactic
nucleus jets. Currently, magnetic fields are considered to be an essential
factor in the launching and accelerating of the jet. However, current
observational estimates of the magnetic field strength of the M87 jet are
limited to the innermost part of the jet or to HST-1. No attempt has yet been
made to measure the magnetic field strength in between. We aim to infer the
magnetic field strength of the M87 jet out to a distance of several thousand
$r_s$ by tracking the distance-dependent changes in the synchrotron spectrum of
the jet from high-resolution very long baseline interferometry observations. In
order to obtain high-quality spectral index maps, quasi-simultaneous
observations at 22 and 43 GHz were conducted using the KVN and VERA Array
(KaVA) and the VLBA. We compared the spectral index distributions obtained from
the observations with a model and placed limits on the magnetic field strengths
as a function of distance. The overall spectral morphology is broadly
consistent over the course of these observations. The observed synchrotron
spectrum rapidly steepens from $\alpha_{22-43 GHz}$ ~ -0.7 at ~ 2 mas to
$\alpha_{22-43 GHz}$ ~ -2.5 at ~ 6 mas. A spectral index model in which
nonthermal electron injections inside the jet decrease with distance can
adequately reproduce the observed trend. This suggests the magnetic field
strength of the jet at a distance of 2 - 10 mas (~ 900 $r_s$ - ~ 4500 $r_s$ in
the deprojected distance) has a range of $B=(0.3 - 1.0 G)(z/2 mas)^{-0.73}$.
Extrapolating to the EHT scale yields consistent results, suggesting that the
majority of the magnetic flux of the jet near the black hole is preserved out
to ~ 4500 $r_s$ without significant dissipation.

  Obtaining high-resolution images at centimeter-or-longer wavelengths is vital
for understanding the physics of jets. We reconstructed images from the M87 22
GHz data observed with the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) by using the
regularized maximum likelihood (RML) method, which is different from the
conventional imaging method CLEAN. Consequently, a bright core and jet
extending about 30 mas to the northwest were detected with a higher resolution
than in the CLEAN image. The width of the jet was 0.5 mas at 0.3 mas from the
core, consistent with the width measured in the 86 GHz image in the previous
study. In addition, three ridges were able to be detected at around 8 mas from
the core, even though the peak-to-peak separation was only 1.0 mas. This
indicates that the RML image's spatial resolution is at least 30% higher than
that of the CLEAN image. This study is an important step for future
multi-frequency and high-cadence observations of the EAVN to discuss the more
detailed structure of the jet and its time variability.

  Understanding the natal kicks received by neutron stars (NSs) during
formation is a critical component of modelling the evolution of massive
binaries. Natal kicks are an integral input parameter for population synthesis
codes, and have implications for the formation of double NS systems and their
subsequent merger rates. However, many of the standard observational kick
distributions that are used are obtained from samples created only from
isolated NSs. Kick distributions derived in this way overestimate the intrinsic
NS kick distribution. For NSs in binaries, we can only directly estimate the
effect of the natal kick on the binary system, instead of the natal kick
received by the NS itself. Here, for the first time, we present a binary kick
distribution for NSs with low-mass companions. We compile a catalogue of 145
NSs in low-mass binaries with the best available constraints on proper motion,
distance, and systemic radial velocity. For each binary, we use a
three-dimensional approach to estimate its binary kick. We discuss the
implications of these kicks on system formation, and provide a parametric model
for the overall binary kick distribution, for use in future theoretical
modelling work. We compare our results with other work on isolated NSs and NSs
in binaries, finding that the NS kick distributions fit using only isolated
pulsars underestimate the fraction of NSs that receive low kicks. We discuss
the implications of our results on modelling double NS systems, and provide
suggestions on how to use our results in future theoretical works.

  Recent VLBI monitoring has found transverse motions of the M87 jet. However,
due to the limited cadence of previous observations, details of the transverse
motion have not been fully revealed yet. We have regularly monitored the M87
jet at KVN and VERA Array (KaVA) 22 GHz from December 2013 to June 2016. The
average time interval of the observation is ~ 0.1 year, which is suitable for
tracking short-term structural changes. From these observations, the M87 jet is
well represented by double ridge lines in the region 2 - 12 mas from the core.
We found that the ridge lines exhibit transverse oscillations in all observed
regions with an average period of $0.94\pm0.12$ years. When the sinusoidal fit
is performed, we found that the amplitude of this oscillation is an order of
$\sim0.1$ mas, and the oscillations in the northern and southern limbs are
almost in phase. Considering the amplitude, it does not originate from Earth's
parallax. We propose possible scenarios of the transverse oscillation, such as
the propagation of jet instabilities or magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves or
perturbed mass injection around magnetically dominated accretion flows.

  How black holes consume and eject matter has been the subject of intense
studies for more than 60 years. The luminosity of these systems are often
compared to the Eddington limit, the border at which the spherical accretion is
inhibited by the radiation pressure of photons it produces. The discovery of
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) showed that accretion can proceed even when
the apparent luminosity exceeds the Eddington limit (Kaaret et al. 2017). High
apparent luminosity might be produced by the beaming of the incident radiation
by a thick collimated outflow or by a truly super-Eddington accretion flow.
However, possibilities to study these outflows in detail are limited, as ULXs
are typically found in distant galaxies. Using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry
Explorer (IXPE, Weisskopf et al. 2022), we made the first measurement of X-ray
polarization in Galactic X-ray binary Cyg X-3. The detection of high,
$\approx$25\%, nearly energy-independent linear polarization, orthogonal to the
direction of the radio ejections, unambiguously indicates the primary source is
obscured and the observer on Earth only sees reflected and scattered light.
Modelling shows there is an optically thick envelope with a narrow funnel
around the primary X-ray source in the system. We derive an upper limit on the
opening angle of the funnel that implies a lower limit on the beamed luminosity
exceeding the Eddington value. We show that Cyg X-3 is viewed as a ULX to an
extragalactic observer located along the axis of the funnel. Our findings
reveal this unique persistent source as an ideal laboratory for the study of
the inner workings of ULX central engines.

  GRB 221009A is the brightest gamma-ray burst ever detected since the
discovery of this kind of energetic explosions. However, an accurate
measurement of the prompt emission properties of this burst is very challenging
due to its exceptional brightness. With joint observations of
\textit{Insight}-HXMT and GECAM-C, we made an unprecedentedly accurate
measurement of the emission during the first $\sim$1800 s of GRB 221009A,
including its precursor, main emission (ME, which dominates the burst in flux),
flaring emission and early afterglow, in the hard X-ray to soft gamma-ray band
from $\sim$ 10 keV to $\sim$ 6 MeV. Based on the GECAM-C unsaturated data of
the ME, we measure a record-breaking isotropic equivalent energy ($E_{\rm
iso}$) of $\bf \sim 1.5 \times 10^{55}$ erg, which is about eight times the
total rest-mass energy of the Sun. The early afterglow data require a
significant jet break between 650 s and 1100 s, most likely at $\sim950$ s from
the afterglow starting time $T_{AG}$, which corresponds to a jet opening angle
of $\sim {0.7^\circ} \ (\eta_\gamma n)^{1/8}$, where $n$ is the ambient medium
density in units of $\rm cm^{-3}$ and $\eta_\gamma$ is the ratio between
$\gamma$-ray energy and afterglow kinetic energy. The beaming-corrected total
$\gamma$-ray energy $E_{\gamma}$ is $\sim 1.15 \times10^{51} \ (\eta_\gamma
n)^{1/4}$ erg, which is typical for long GRBs. These results suggest that this
GRB may have a special central engine, which could launch and collimate a very
narrowly beamed jet with an ordinary energy budget, leading to exceptionally
luminous gamma-ray radiation per unit solid angle. Alternatively, more GRBs
might have such a narrow and bright beam, which are missed by an unfavorable
viewing angle or have been detected without distance measurement.

Title: No Need for an Extreme Jet Energy in the Black-Hole X-Ray Binary MAXI
  J1348--630
Authors: Andrzej A. Zdziarski, Marek Sikora, Michal Szanecki and Markus
  Boettcher
Categories: astro-ph.HE
Comments: submitted to ApJ
\\
  We model interaction with the surrounding medium of the main discrete jet
ejection in the accreting black-hole binary MAXI J1348--630. The kinetic energy
in the ejection of that jet was estimated before to be $>10^{46}$ erg. That
energy requires that the jet power was about two orders of magnitude above the
limit corresponding to a magnetically arrested accretion onto a maximally
rotating black hole. That estimate was obtained by considering the initial
ballistic jet propagation in a surrounding cavity followed by a sudden
deceleration in the interstellar medium under the assumption of its standard
density of $\sim$1 cm$^{-3}$. Such densities are likely in the surrounding of
this source given its location in the Galactic Plane. Here, we show that the
estimate of the kinetic energy can be reduced to realistic values of $\sim\!
10^{44}$ erg by considering the presence of a transition layer with an
exponential density growth separating the cavity and the interstellar medium.
In that case, the jet is found to decelerate mostly in the transition layer, in
regions with the densities $\ll$1 cm$^{-3}$, which strongly reduces the energy
requirement. Still, the required jet masses are large, ruling out the presence
of a significant number of electron-positron pairs.

  Central Compact Objects (CCOs) are neutron stars found close to the centers
of some supernova remnants. Some of them are presumably covered by carbon
envelopes. Their unpulsed thermal X-ray emission can originate either from the
entire surface covered by a carbon atmosphere or a non-uniformly emitting
hydrogen atmosphere as an alternative. However, the latter scenario appears
unlikely given the available upper limits on the amplitude of pulsations. Here
we explore a possibility to further discriminate between the two scenarios
using X-ray polarimetric observations. We compute the polarization degree (PD)
for non-magnetized pure carbon and pure hydrogen atmospheres with effective
temperatures between 1 and 6 MK and find that it can reach up to 25% and 40%
for hydrogen and carbon atmospheres, respectively, in the photon energy band
1-10 keV. However, given the available constraints on possible inhomogeneities
of the temperature distribution deduced from modeling of the X-ray spectrum of
the CCO in HESS J1731-347, the integrated PD appears to be very low both for
carbon (<0.25%) and hydrogen (a few %) compositions in the energy band of 2-8
keV covered by the recently launched Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. We
conclude, therefore, that polarization from CCOs is not expected to be
detectable by current facilities, but future detection would strongly support
non-uniform hydrogen composition models.

  We report two new radio detections of cataclysmic variables (CVs), and place
them in context with radio and X-ray detections of other CVs. We detected QS
Vir, a low accretion-rate CV; V2400 Oph, a diskless intermediate polar (IP);
and recovered the polar AM Her in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) 2-4
GHz radio images. The radio luminosities of these systems are higher than
typically expected from coronal emission from stars of similar spectral types,
and neither system is expected to produce jets, leaving the origin of the radio
emission a puzzle. The radio emission mechanism for these two CVs may be
electron-cyclotron maser emission, synchrotron radiation, or a more exotic
process. We compile published radio detections of CVs, and X-ray measurements
of these CVs, to illustrate their locations in the radio - X-ray luminosity
plane, a diagnostic tool often used for X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei,
and radio stars. Several radio-emitting CVs, including these two newly detected
CVs, seem to lie near the principal radio/X-ray track followed by black hole
X-ray binaries (BHXBs) at low luminosity, suggesting additional complexity in
classifying unknown systems using their radio and X-ray luminosities alone.

Title: VARAHA: A Fast Non-Markovian sampler for estimating Gravitational-Wave
  posteriors
Authors: Vaibhav Tiwari, Charlie Hoy, Stephen Fairhurst and Duncan MacLeod
Categories: astro-ph.HE
\\
  This article introduces VARAHA, an open-source, fast, non-Markovian sampler
for estimating gravitational-wave posteriors. VARAHA differs from existing
Nested sampling algorithms by gradually discarding regions of low likelihood,
rather than gradually sampling regions of high likelihood. This alternative
mindset enables VARAHA to freely draw samples from anywhere within the
high-likelihood region of the parameter space, allowing for analyses to
complete in significantly fewer cycles. This means that VARAHA can
significantly reduce both the wall and CPU time of all analyses. VARAHA offers
many benefits, particularly for gravitational-wave astronomy where Bayesian
inference can take many days, if not weeks, to complete. For instance, VARAHA
can be used to estimate accurate sky locations, astrophysical probabilities and
source classifications within minutes, which is particularly useful for
multi-messenger follow-up of binary neutron star observations; VARAHA localises
GW170817 $\sim 30$ times faster than LALInference. Although only aligned-spin,
dominant multipole waveform models can be used for gravitational-wave analyses,
it is trivial to extend this algorithm to include additional physics without
hindering performance. We envision VARAHA being used for gravitational-wave
studies, particularly estimating parameters using expensive waveform models,
analysing subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates, generating simulated data
for population studies, and rapid posterior estimation for binary neutron star
mergers.

  Massive black hole (BH) mergers will be key targets of future gravitational
wave and electromagnetic observational facilities. In order to constrain BH
evolution with the information extracted from BH mergers, one must take into
account the complex relationship between the population of merging BHs and the
global BH population. We analyse the high-resolution cosmological
radiation-hydrodynamics simulation Obelisk, run to redshift $z=3.5$, to study
the properties of the merging BH population, and its differences with the
underlying global BH population in terms of BH and galaxy properties. We
calculate in post-processing dynamical delays between the merger in the
simulation at the resolution limit and the actual coalescence well below the
resolution scale. We find that merging BHs are hosted in relatively massive
galaxies with stellar mass $M_\ast\gtrsim10^9\,M_\odot$. Given that galaxy mass
is correlated with other BH and galaxy properties, BH mergers tend to also have
higher total BH mass and higher BH accretion rates than the global population
of main BHs. These differences generally disappear if the merger population is
compared with a BH population sampled with the same galaxy mass distribution as
merger hosts. Galaxy mergers can temporarily boost the BH accretion rate and
the host's star formation rate, which can remain active at the BH merger if
sub-resolution delays are not taken into account. When dynamical delays are
taken into account the burst has generally faded by the time the BHs merge. BH
spins are followed self-consistently in the simulation, under the effect of
accretion and BH mergers. We find that merging BHs have higher spins than the
global population, but similar or somewhat lower spins compared to a
mass-matched sample. For our sample, mergers tend to decrease the spin of the
final BH remnant.

Title: Discovery of Extended Fe Ka Complex X-ray Emission in NGC 5728
Authors: Anna Trindade Falcao, G. Fabbiano, M. Elvis, A. Paggi, W. P. Maksym
Categories: astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE
\\
  We present Chandra ACIS imaging spectroscopy results for the extended
(1.5$''$-8$''$) hard X-ray emission of the Compton thick (CT) Seyfert NGC 5728.
We find spectrally and spatially-resolved features in the Fe K$\alpha$ complex
(5.5-7.2 keV), redward and blueward of the neutral 6.4 keV line in the extended
bicone. The [red, blue] features have [6.5$\sigma$, 5.3$\sigma$] significance,
with an equivalent width = [1.76 keV, 2.60 keV], much higher than in the
nuclear spectrum. Hence these red and blue wings are extended in a few
arcsecond scale, as confirmed by narrow-band X-ray imaging. These energies
imply line-of-sight velocities of [$\sim$19,000-42,000, $\sim$ 28,000] km
s$^{-1}$, if the emission is due to neutral Fe K$\alpha$.

  The astronomical transient AT2018cow is the closest example of the new class
of luminous, fast blue optical transients (FBOTs). Liverpool Telescope RINGO3
observations of AT2018cow are reported here, which constitute the earliest
polarimetric observations of an FBOT. At 5.7 days post-explosion, the optical
emission of AT2018cow exhibited a chromatic polarization spike that reached ~7%
at red wavelengths. This is the highest intrinsic polarization recorded for a
non-relativistic explosive transient, and is observed in multiple bands and at
multiple epochs over the first night of observations, before rapidly declining.
The apparent wavelength dependence of the polarization may arise through
depolarization or dilution of the polarized flux, due to conditions in
AT~2018cow at early times. A second ``bump" in the polarization is observed at
blue wavelengths at ~12 days. Such a high polarization requires an extremely
aspherical geometry that is only apparent for a brief period (<1 day), such as
shock breakout through an optically thick disk. For a disk-like configuration,
the ratio of the thickness to radial extent must be ~10%.

Title: Diving into the magnetosphere of the Of?p star HD108
Authors: Gregor Rauw, Ya\"el Naz\'e, Asif ud-Doula, Coralie Neiner
Categories: astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE
Comments: Accepted for publication in MNRAS
\\
  We analyse optical and X-ray spectroscopy of the Of?p star HD108, known for
its strong dipolar magnetic field and its optical line profile variability with
a timescale of $54 \pm 3$ yrs, interpreted as the stellar rotation period.
Optical emission lines have now recovered from their minimum emission state
reached in 2007 - 2008. The variations of the equivalent width of the H$\alpha$
emission provide constraints on the inclination of the rotation axis ($i$) and
the obliquity of the magnetic axis ($\beta$). The best agreement between model
and observations is found for ($i$, $\beta$) pairs with $i + \beta \simeq
85^{\circ}$ and $i \in [30^{\circ},55^{\circ}]$. The Balmer emission lines
display stochastic variability at the $\sim 5$ % level on timescales of a few
days. TESS photometry unveils transient modulations on similar timescales in
addition to prominent red noise variations. A Chandra X-ray observation of
December 2021, when the star was at a higher emission level, indicates a slight
increase of the flux and a spectral hardening compared to the August 2002
XMM-Newton observation, taken near minimum emission state. Magnetohydrodynamic
simulations are used to compute synthetic X-ray spectra. With our current best
estimate of the $\dot{M}_{B=0}$ mass-loss rate, the simulated X-ray luminosity
and spectral energy distribution agree very well with the observations.
Finally, the radial velocities vary on a period of 8.5 years with a
peak-to-peak amplitude of 10 - 11 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting orbital motion with
an unseen companion of at least 4 M$_{\odot}$.

Title: Excitation of Langmuir waves in the magnetospheres of AGN
Authors: Z.N. Osmanov
Categories: astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE physics.plasm-ph
Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures
\\
  In the paper we study the process of excitation of Langmuir waves in the
magnetospheres of active galactic nuclei (AGN), by taking a
general-relativistic expression of the Goldreich-Julian density into account.
We considered the linearised set of equations which describe dynamics of the
studied mechanism: the Euler equation, the continuity equation and the Poisson
equation. After solving the dispersion relation and obtaining the instability
growth rate, we explored it versus several physical parameters: electron's and
proton's relativistic factors and the mass and luminosity of AGN, which are
supposed to be Kerr black holes. We showed that the parametric process of
energy pumping into the Langmuir waves is very efficient and the electrostatic
field's amplitude will be exponentially amplifying, which might account for
pair creation, particle acceleration and plasma heating processes in the nearby
regions of AGN.

Title: Eccentricity-tide coupling: impact on binary neutron stars and extreme
  mass-ratio inspirals
Authors: John Paul Bernaldez and Sayak Datta
Categories: gr-qc astro-ph.HE
\\
  We study the effect of tidal interaction between two compact bodies in an
eccentric orbit. We assume the tidal fields to be static. Therefore, we ignore
the dynamic tides and resonant excitations. Using the results, we find the
analytical expression for the phase shift of the emitted gravitational wave. In
the process, we find that in the leading order, the initial eccentricity $e_0$
and the dimensionless tidal deformability $\Lambda$ couple as $\sim
e_0^n\Lambda$, where $n$ is a positive number. We only focus on the dominant
contribution, i.e., $e_0^2\Lambda$. We also compute the accumulated dephasing
for binary neutron star systems. We find that for optimistic values of
eccentricities $e_0 \sim .05$ and $\Lambda \sim 600$, the accumulated dephasing
is $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ radian, requiring a signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 7000$
to be observable. Therefore, these effects can be measured in binary neutron
star systems with large eccentricities if the signal-to-noise ratios of the
systems are also very large. Hence, in third-generation detectors, it may have
an observable impact if the systems have large eccentricities. We also explore
the impact of this effect on extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We find that
even for supermassive bodies with small values of $\Lambda \sim 10^{-3}$, this
effect has large dephasing in EMRIs $\sim \mathcal{O}(10)$ radian. Therefore,
this effect will help in probing the nature of the supermassive bodies in an
EMRI.
