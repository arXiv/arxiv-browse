  Galaxy-scale strong lenses in galaxy clusters provide a unique tool to
investigate their inner mass distribution and the sub-halo density profiles in
the low-mass regime, which can be compared with the predictions from
cosmological simulations. We search for galaxy-galaxy strong-lensing systems in
HST multi-band imaging of galaxy cluster cores from the CLASH and HFF programs
by exploring the classification capabilities of deep learning techniques.
Convolutional neural networks are trained utilising highly-realistic
simulations of galaxy-scale strong lenses injected into the HST cluster fields
around cluster members. To this aim, we take advantage of extensive
spectroscopic information on member galaxies in 16 clusters and the accurate
knowledge of the deflection fields in half of these from high-precision strong
lensing models. Using observationally-based distributions, we sample
magnitudes, redshifts and sizes of the background galaxy population. By placing
these sources within the secondary caustics associated with cluster galaxies,
we build a sample of ~3000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses which preserve the full
complexity of real multi-colour data and produce a wide diversity of strong
lensing configurations. We study two deep learning networks processing a large
sample of image cutouts in three HST/ACS bands, and we quantify their
classification performance using several standard metrics. We find that both
networks achieve a very good trade-off between purity and completeness
(85%-95%), as well as good stability with fluctuations within 2%-4%. We
characterise the limited number of false negatives and false positives in terms
of the physical properties of the background sources and cluster members. We
also demonstrate the neural networks' high degree of generalisation by applying
our method to HST observations of 12 clusters with previously known
galaxy-scale lensing systems.

  Diffusion damping of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum
results from imperfect photon-baryon coupling in the pre-recombination plasma.
At redshift $5 \times 10^4 < z < 2 \times 10^6$, the plasma acquires an
effective chemical potential, and energy injections from acoustic damping in
this era create $\mu$-type spectral distortions of the CMB. These $\mu$
distortions trace the underlying photon density fluctuations, probing the
primordial power spectrum in short-wavelength modes $k_\mathrm{S}$ over the
range $50 \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim 10^4 \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.
Small-scale power modulated by long-wavelength modes $k_\mathrm{L}$ from
squeezed-limit non-Gaussianities introduces cross-correlations between CMB
temperature anisotropies and $\mu$ distortions. Under single-field inflation
models, $\mu \times T$ correlations measured from an observer in an inertial
frame should vanish up to a factor of $(k_\mathrm{L}/k_\mathrm{S})^2 \ll 1$.
Thus, any measurable correlation rules out single-field inflation models. We
forecast how well the next-generation ground-based CMB experiment CMB-S4 will
be able to constrain primordial squeezed-limit non-Gaussianity, parameterized
by $f_\mathrm{NL}$, using measurements of $C_{\ell}^{\mu T}$ as well as
$C_{\ell}^{\mu E}$ from CMB $E$ modes. Using current experimental
specifications and foreground modeling, we expect $\sigma(f_\mathrm{NL})
\lesssim 1000$. This is roughly four times better than the current limit on
$f_\mathrm{NL}$ using $\mu \times T$ and $\mu \times E$ correlations from
Planck and is comparable to what is achievable with LiteBIRD, demonstrating the
power of the CMB-S4 experiment. This measurement is at an effective scale of $k
\simeq 740 \ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and is thus highly complementary to measurements
at larger scales from primary CMB and large-scale structure.

Title: Observational constraints on non-cold dark matter and phenomenological
  emergent dark energy
Authors: Yan-Hong Yao, Jun-Chao Wang, Xin-He Meng
Categories: astro-ph.CO
Comments: 7 pages, 2 figure
\\
  Although almost all of the models proposed to resolve several long-standing
problems making $\Lambda$CDM imperfect assume that dark matter is pressureless,
the probability that dark matter is non-cold is still not excluded by current
observations. Therefore, in this article, we treat the equation of state for
dark matter as a free parameter, and apply observational data to investigate
the non-coldness of dark matter. Impressing by the simplicity of the
phenomenological emergent dark energy (PEDE) and its ability to relieve the
Hubble tension, we propose the PEDE+$w$DM model based on PEDE and non-cold dark
matter. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic
oscillation(BAO) measurements and the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia
supernovae. The results indicate a preference for a negative dark matter
equation of state at $95\%$ CL for all data sets except CMB alone, which
suggests that the non-coldness assumption of dark matter worth to be
investigated further in order to understand the nature of dark matter.

Title: Implications of multi-axion dark matter on structure formation
Authors: Chong-Bin Chen, Jiro Soda
Categories: astro-ph.CO gr-qc
Comments: 33 pages, 17 figures
\\
  Axions are candidates for dark matter in the universe. We developed an
accurate numerical code to study multi-axion dark matter. As an interesting
example, we investigate a mixed dark matter model consisting of cold dark
matter (CDM) and two-axion dark matter. We analyze the growth of the structure
numerically and analytically. We find that an effective single axion with an
effective mass and an effective abundance is useful to characterize the
two-axion cosmology. Moreover, we generalize the effective single axion
description to multi-axion dark matter cosmology. We also compare the results
with those of warm dark matter (WDM) model. Moreover, we calculate halo mass
functions for the mixed model and determine the mass function as a function of
masses and axion abundance.

  Measurements of the growth rate of structures at $z < 0.1$ with peculiar
velocity surveys have the potential of testing the validity of general
relativity on cosmic scales. In this work, we present growth-rate measurements
from realistic simulated sets of type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF). We describe our simulation methodology, the
light-curve fitting and peculiar velocity estimation. Using the maximum
likelihood method, we derive constraints on $f\sigma_8$ using only ZTF SN Ia
peculiar velocities. We carefully tested the method and we quantified biases
due to selection effects (photometric detection, spectroscopic follow-up for
typing) on several independent realizations. We simulated the equivalent of 6
years of ZTF data, and considering an unbiased spectroscopically typed sample
at $z < 0.06$, we obtained unbiased estimates of $f\sigma_8$ with an average
uncertainty of 19% precision. We also investigated the information gain in
applying bias correction methods. Our results validate our framework which can
be used on real ZTF data.

Title: Revisiting the alignment of radio galaxies in the ELAIS-N1 field

  Aims. Previous studies reported an alignment of the major axes of radio
galaxies on various angular scales. Here, we study the alignment of radio
galaxies in the ELAIS-N1 Low Frequency ARray (LOFAR) deep field, which covers
an area of 25 $\rm deg^2$. \newline Methods. The low noise level of about 20$
\rm ~ \mu Jy/beam$ of the LOFAR deep field observations at 150 MHz enabled the
identification of 447 extended ($> 30 \rm ''$) radio galaxies for which we have
measured the major axis position angle. We found that 95\% of these sources
have either photometric or spectroscopic redshifts, which we then used for a
three-dimensional analysis. \newline Results. We show the distribution of the
position angles of radio galaxies in the ELAIS-N1 field and perform multiple
statistical tests to check whether the radio galaxies are randomly oriented. We
found that the distribution of position angles is consistent with being
uniform. Two peaks around position angles of 50 and 140$\rm~ deg$ are spurious
and are not caused by an alignment, as shown by a 3D analysis. In conclusion,
our results do not support a 2D or 3D alignment of radio galaxies on scales
smaller than $\sim 4 \rm ~ deg$.

  Because of its proximity and the large size of its black hole, M87 is one of
the best targets for studying the launching mechanism of active galactic
nucleus jets. Currently, magnetic fields are considered to be an essential
factor in the launching and accelerating of the jet. However, current
observational estimates of the magnetic field strength of the M87 jet are
limited to the innermost part of the jet or to HST-1. No attempt has yet been
made to measure the magnetic field strength in between. We aim to infer the
magnetic field strength of the M87 jet out to a distance of several thousand
$r_s$ by tracking the distance-dependent changes in the synchrotron spectrum of
the jet from high-resolution very long baseline interferometry observations. In
order to obtain high-quality spectral index maps, quasi-simultaneous
observations at 22 and 43 GHz were conducted using the KVN and VERA Array
(KaVA) and the VLBA. We compared the spectral index distributions obtained from
the observations with a model and placed limits on the magnetic field strengths
as a function of distance. The overall spectral morphology is broadly
consistent over the course of these observations. The observed synchrotron
spectrum rapidly steepens from $\alpha_{22-43 GHz}$ ~ -0.7 at ~ 2 mas to
$\alpha_{22-43 GHz}$ ~ -2.5 at ~ 6 mas. A spectral index model in which
nonthermal electron injections inside the jet decrease with distance can
adequately reproduce the observed trend. This suggests the magnetic field
strength of the jet at a distance of 2 - 10 mas (~ 900 $r_s$ - ~ 4500 $r_s$ in
the deprojected distance) has a range of $B=(0.3 - 1.0 G)(z/2 mas)^{-0.73}$.
Extrapolating to the EHT scale yields consistent results, suggesting that the
majority of the magnetic flux of the jet near the black hole is preserved out
to ~ 4500 $r_s$ without significant dissipation.
