  We discuss tensor categories motivated by CFT, their unitarizability and
applications to various models including the affine VOAs. We discuss
classification of type A Verlinde fusion categories.
  We propose an approach to Kazhdan-Lusztig-Finkelberg theorem. This theorem
gives a ribbon equivalence between the fusion category associated to a quantum
group at a certain root of unity and that associated to a corresponding affine
vertex operator algebra at a suitable positive integer level. We develop ideas
by Wenzl.
  Our results rely on the notion of weak-quasi-Hopf algebra of
Drinfeld-Mack-Schomerus. We were also guided by Drinfeld original proof, by
Bakalov and Kirillov and Neshveyev and Tuset work for a generic parameter.
  Wenzl described a fusion tensor product in quantum group fusion categories,
and related it to the unitary structure. Given two irreducible objects, the
inner product of the fusion tensor product is induced by the braiding of
U_q(g), with q a suitable root of 1. Moreover, the paper suggests a suitable
untwisting procedure to make the unitary structure trivial. Then it also
describes a continuous path that intuitively connects objects of the quantum
group fusion category to representations of the simple Lie group defining the
affine Lie algebra. We study this procedure.
  One of our main results is the construction of a Hopf algebra in a weak sense
associated to quantum group fusion category and of a twist of it giving a wqh
structure on the Zhu algebra and a unitary modular fusion category structure on
the representation category of the affine Lie algebra, confirming an early view
by Frenkel and Zhu.
  We show that this modular fusion category structure is equivalent to that
obtained via the tensor product theory of VOAs by Huang and Lepowsky. This
gives a direct proof of FKL theorem.
