Title: A fresh look at maximum parsimony
Authors: Trevor Bruen, David Bryant

  This paper presents a new description of the maximum parsimony criterion. In
particular, this paper demonstrates a new mathematical equivalence between
Fitch parsimony as well as selection of certain types of consensus trees. The
link between parsimony and consensus is intended to contribute to the
discussion on parsimony as well as consensus and total evidence. A link between
parsimony and consensus trees has already been established by the MRP (matrix
representation with parsimony) method of Baum and Ragan
\citep{Baum1992,Ragan1992}. Here, however, a link arises in the other
direction: whereas Baum and Ragan use parsimony to solve a problem in consensus
trees, in this paper parsimony itself is shown to be a consensus method. Unless
otherwise indicated, the term {\em parsimony} denotes Fitch parsimony.
