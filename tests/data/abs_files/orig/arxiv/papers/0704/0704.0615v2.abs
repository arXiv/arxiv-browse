  This paper presents a new description of the maximum parsimony criterion. In
particular, this paper demonstrates a new mathematical equivalence between
Fitch parsimony as well as selection of certain types of consensus trees. The
link between parsimony and consensus is intended to contribute to the
discussion on parsimony as well as consensus and total evidence. Unless
otherwise indicated, the term {\em parsimony} denotes Fitch parsimony.
