  In this paper we consider the lower order eigenvalues of biharmonic operator
on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary (possibly empty) and prove a type
of general inequalities for them. In particular, we study the lower order
eigenvalues of biharmonic operator on compact submanifolds of Euclidean spaces,
of spheres, and of projective spaces. We obtain some estimates for lower order
eigenvalues of biharmonic operator on such objects.
