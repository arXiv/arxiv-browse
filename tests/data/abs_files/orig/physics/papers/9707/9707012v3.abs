  We connect the classical free damping cases by means of Rosner's construction
in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Starting with the critical damping, one
can obtain in the underdamping case a chirping of instantaneous physical
frequency \omega ^{2}(t) \propto \omega_{u}^{2}sech^2(\omega_{u}t), whereas in
the overdamped case the "chirping" is of the (unphysical) type \omega
^{2}(t)\propto\omega_{o}^{2}sec^{2}(\omega_{o}t), where \omega_{u}$ and
$\omega_{o} are the underdamped and overdamped frequency parameters,
respectively
