  We present photometric analysis of a local sample of 14 isolated pairs of
galaxies. The photometric properties analyzed in the local pairs are: colors,
morphology, tidal effects and activity. We verify that close pairs have an
excess of early-type galaxies and many elliptical galaxies in this pairs are,
in fact, lenticular galaxies. Many late-pairs in our sample show strong tidal
damage and blue star formation regions. We conclude that pairs of different
morphologies may have passed through different evolution processes which
violently transformed their morphology. Pairs with at least one early-type
component may be descendents of groups of galaxies. However, late-type pairs
are probably long-lived showing clearly signs of interaction. Some of them
could be seen as an early stage of mergers. These photometric database will be
used for future comparison with more distant pairs in order to study galaxy
evolution.
