Title: Localization transition of random copolymers at interfaces

  We consider adsorption of random copolymer chains onto an interface within
the model of Garel et al. Europhysics Letters 8, 9 (1989). By using the replica
method the adsorption of the copolymer at the interface is mapped onto the
problem of finding the ground state of a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian. To
study this ground state we introduce a novel variational principle for the
Green's function, which generalizes the well-known Rayleigh-Ritz method of
Quantum Mechanics to nonstationary states. Minimization with an appropriate
trial Green's function enables us to find the phase diagram for the
localization-delocalization transition for an ideal random copolymer at the
interface. We predict that even in the case of symmetric composition (the
fraction of two types of monomers is the same in the ensemble of random
copolymers) the ground state is asymmetric.
