<H2><A name=exec></A>Executive Summary</H2>

People are concerned about privacy, particularly on the
Internet. While many studies have provided evidence of this concern,
few have explored the nature of the concern in detail, especially for
the online environment. With this study, we have tried to better
understand the nature of online privacy concerns; we look beyond the
fact that people are concerned and attempt to understand <I>how</I>
they are concerned. We hope our results will help inform both policy
decisions as well as the development of technology tools that can
assist Internet users in protecting their privacy.

<P>We present results here from the
analysis of 381 questionnaires completed between November 6 and
November 13, 1998 by American Internet users. The sample was drawn
from the <i>FamilyPC</i> magazine/Digital Research, Inc. Family Panel. While
this is not a statistically representative sample of US Internet
users, our respondents are heavy Internet users, and quite possibly
lead innovators. As such, we believe that this sample is important for
understanding the future Internet user population.  

<H4>Major
Findings</H4> <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Internet users are more likely to provide
information when they
  are not identified. </B>When presented with scenarios involving the provision 
  of personal data to Web sites, our respondents were much less willing to 
  provide information when personally identifiable information was 
requested.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Some types of data are more sensitive than others.</B> Our 
  respondents were generally comfortable providing preference information to Web 
  sites. However, they were often very uncomfortable providing credit card 
  numbers and social security numbers. We also observed significant differences 
  in sensitivity to seemingly similar kinds of data. For example, while postal 
  mail address, phone number, and email address can all be used to contact 
  someone, most of our respondents said they would never or rarely feel 
  comfortable providing their phone number but would usually or always feel 
  comfortable providing their email address. The comfort level for postal mail 
  address fell somewhere in between.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Many factors are important in decisions about information 
  disclosure.</B> When deciding whether to provide information to Web sites, our 
  respondents report that the most important factor is whether or not 
  information will be shared with other companies and organizations. Other 
  highly important factors include whether information is used in an 
  identifiable way, the kind of information collected, and the purpose for which 
  the information is collected. Whether a site posts a privacy policy, whether a 
  site has a privacy seal of approval, and whether a site discloses a data 
  retention policy were viewed as important, but considerably less so than the 
  other factors we asked about.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Acceptance of the use of persistent identifiers varies 
  according to their purpose. </B>Fifty-two percent of our respondents indicated 
  they were concerned about Web cookies, and another 12% said they were 
  uncertain about what a cookie is. Of those who knew what cookies were, 56% 
  said they had changed their cookie settings to something other than accepting 
  all cookies without warning. However, 78% of respondents said they would 
  definitely or probably agree to Web sites using persistent identifiers 
  (possibly implemented using cookies) to provide a customized service. Fewer 
  (60%) would agree to the use of such an identifier to provide customized 
  advertising, and fewer still (44%) would agree to using the identifier to 
  provide customized advertising across many Web sites.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Internet users dislike automatic data transfer.</B> While our 
  respondents said they are interested in tools that make using the Web more 
  convenient, most do not want these tools to transfer information about them to 
  Web sites automatically. When asked about several possible browser features 
  that would make it easier to provide information to Web sites, 86% of respondents reported no interest in features 
  that would automatically transfer their data to Web sites without any user 
  intervention.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Internet users dislike unsolicited communications. 
  </B>Respondents indicated a strong desire to avoid unsolicited communications 
  resulting from providing information to Web sites. For example, 61% of 
  respondents who said they would be willing to provide their name and postal 
  mail address to a site in order to receive free pamphlets and coupons said 
  they would be less likely to provide the information if it would be shared 
  with other companies and used to send them additional marketing 
materials.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>A joint program of privacy policies and privacy seals seemingly 
  provides a comparable level of user confidence as that provided by privacy 
  laws.</B> We described a scenario in which a Web site with interesting 
  information related to a favorite hobby asks for a visitor's name and postal 
  address in order to provide free pamphlets and coupons. Of the respondents who 
  were unsure or said they would not provide the requested 
information:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>48% said they would be more likely to provide it if there was a law that 
    prevented the site from using the information for any purpose other than 
    processing the request, 
    <LI>28% said they would be more likely to provide it if the site had a 
    privacy policy, 
    <LI>and 58% said they would be more likely to provide it if the site had 
    both a privacy policy and a seal of approval from a well-known organization 
    such as the Better Business Bureau or the AAA. </LI></UL></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On the other hand, when we asked respondents about online privacy 
  seal programs <I>without mentioning any specific brand names</I>, their 
  responses suggest that they do not yet understand how Internet seal programs 
  work.</BLOCKQUOTE>We are continuing to analyze our survey data and plan to 
collect more data to further explore these and other issues. We expect to 
provide more detailed analyses in future reports. 

<H4>Implications</H4>

Finally, we believe that a few technical and policy implications can
be drawn from our work. As the software engineering community attempts
to implement the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) and similar
privacy protocols, one of the major issues will be designing suitable
user interfaces for these systems. Such systems need to inform users
when user privacy might be at risk. However, not only must a user
interface present an extremely complex information and decision space,
it must do so seamlessly and unobtrusively (Ackerman and Cranor
1999). Our results suggest that for users who either have strong
feelings about privacy or who are marginally concerned about privacy,
very simple interfaces would likely be useful and usable. However, for
the majority of users who take a pragmatic approach to privacy issues,
it seems likely that a variety of mechanisms will be needed. 

<P>While the vast majority of our respondents were concerned about
privacy (only 13% said they were "not very" or "not at all" concerned
about privacy threats), their reactions to scenarios involving online
data collection were extremely varied. Some respondents reported that
they would rarely be willing to provide personal data online, others
showed some willingness to provide data depending on the situation,
and others were quite willing to provide data -- regardless of whether
or not they reported a high level of concern about privacy. Thus <b>it
seems unlikely that a one-size-fits-all approach to online privacy is
likely to succeed.</b>

<BR><BR><BR>
<HR>

<H2><A name=intro></A>Introduction</H2>Over the past decade, numerous surveys 
conducted around the world have found consistently high levels of concern about 
privacy. The more recent studies have found that this concern is as prevalent in 
the online environment as it is for physical-world interactions. For example, 
Westin (1998) found 81% of Net users are concerned about threats to their 
privacy while online. While many studies have measured the magnitude of privacy 
concerns, it is still critical to study the concern in detail, especially for 
the online environment. As Hine and Eve (1998) point out: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Despite this wide range of interests in privacy as a topic, we 
  have little idea of the ways in which people in their ordinary lives conceive 
  of privacy and their reactions to the collection and use of personal 
  information (Hine and Eve 1998, 253)</BLOCKQUOTE>With this study, we have tried 
to better understand the nature of online privacy concerns; we look beyond the 
fact that people are concerned and attempt to understand what aspects of the 
problem they are most concerned about. We hope our results will help inform both 
policy decisions as well as the development of technology tools that can assist 
Internet users in protecting their privacy. 
<P>This insight should be helpful to ongoing privacy activities. Efforts such as 
the World Wide Web Consortium's Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) 
specification and self-regulatory efforts such as TRUSTe and BBBOnline make 
numerous assumptions about how users perceive privacy. The P3P specification 
will lead to interoperable client and service programs that represent site 
privacy practices in ways that can be understood and processed automatically on 
behalf of the user: aiding the user in finding sites and practices she finds 
most appropriate (Reagle and Cranor 1999). Trust label programs promote 
guidelines about privacy disclosures and associate a trusted and branded icon 
with sites that follow those guidelines (Benassi 1999). Consequently, a better 
understanding of privacy concerns will lead to designs that best meet users' 
needs. In particular, we hope to gain an understanding that will inform the 
development of P3P agents and vocabulary -- the set of privacy disclosures that 
can be understood by a user agent. 
<P>This is a report of our preliminary findings concerning Internet users' 
attitudes about privacy. We report our findings on general attitudes about 
online privacy, attitudes about specific current and anticipated online 
information practices, and attitudes about privacy regulation and 
self-regulation. We then describe the major factors that motivate concern about 
privacy, and discuss some technical and policy implications of our findings. 
<H2><A name=method></A>Survey Methodology</H2>
<H3>Survey Development</H3>During the summer of 1998 we developed a series of 
survey questions designed to provide insight into Internet users' attitudes 
about privacy. We were interested in several privacy issues: 
<UL>
  <LI>We wanted to know how people would respond to situations where personal 
  information is collected. In our pre-study, we determined that it was important 
  to ask participants about their concerns through specific online scenarios. 
  Therefore, in&nbsp; addition to the closed form survey questions, we also 
  asked for their reasoning through open-ended questions. 
  <LI>We wanted to know the sensitivity of particular privacy practices relevant 
  to the design of the P3P vocabulary and P3P user agents. We were interested in 
  testing the design of P3P and in creating better privacy user interfaces. 
  Again, we probed for the reasons behind the respondents' sensitivities through 
  open-ended questions in addition to standard-form survey questions. 
  <LI>We wanted to determine participants' general attitudes and demographics. 
  We largely used questions that had appeared on other surveys so we could match 
  our sample against others. </LI></UL>We developed our survey and pre-tested it 
with non-technical employees and summer students at AT&amp;T Labs, as well as 
with two classes at Harvard and MIT. 
<H3>Sample Characteristics and Response Rate</H3>Prospective survey participants 
were selected from the Digital Research, Inc. (DRI) Family Panel. The DRI Family 
Panel is a group of Internet users that evaluates products and responds to 
surveys for <I>FamilyPC</I> magazine. Approximately one-third of the panel members are 
<I>FamilyPC</I> subscribers, and most of the panel members who are not 
subscribers joined the panel after visiting the FamilyPC Web site. 
<P>Invitations to complete a Web-based survey were emailed to 1,500 Family Panel 
members (selected randomly, but weighted so that approximately 20% were sent to 
members outside the US), resulting in 523 surveys completed between November 6 
and November 23, 1998 -- a response rate of 35%.&nbsp; Code numbers were used to 
ensure that each respondent filled out the survey only once, and a sweepstakes 
was offered to encourage participation. 
<P>Out of the total sample, 405 completed surveys were from the United States, 
88 were from Canada, and 30 were from other countries. We report on only the 
United States participants here. We eliminated surveys from respondents who did 
not answer at least two of our demographic questions, leaving us with 381 
respondents in our US sample. 
<P>We did not obtain a statistically representative sample of United States 
citizens. However, our sample holds similar attitudes about privacy as the 460 
Internet users in Westin's April 1998 sample, with our sample tending towards 
slightly more concern about privacy. For example, 87% of our US sample and 81% 
of the Net users in Westin's sample were somewhat or very concerned about 
threats to their personal privacy while online. 
<P>Our US sample differed from a nationally representative sample in some 
demographic areas. Most significantly our sample was more educated and had more 
Internet experience than nationally representative samples of Internet users, 
such as Westin's April 1998 sample or the IntelliQuest 
(http://www.intelliquest.com/) third-quarter 1998 sample. While 37% of Westin's 
sample and 36% of the IntelliQuest sample reportedly held college and/or 
postgraduate degrees, 48% of our sample reported such degrees. Furthermore 77% 
of our sample reported that they make online purchases compared with 23% of 
Westin's sample and 20% of the IntelliQuest sample. Finally, fifty-one percent 
of our sample reported household incomes greater than $50,000, compared to 43% 
of Westin's sample and 55% of the IntelliQuest sample. The higher education and 
income levels coupled with increased number of online purchasers in our sample 
is consistent with Westin's (1998, 40) finding that online purchasers are more 
educated and affluent than other members of the public. 
<P>Our sample is certainly not statistically representative of US Internet 
users. However, our users are heavy Internet users -- 65% report using the 
Internet several times a day -- and quite possibly lead innovators. We base this 
on the above statistics, their self-selection in an opinion-formation group, and 
much of our qualitative data. As such, we believe that this sample is important 
for understanding the future Internet user population. As more people start 
using the Internet and gaining experience with email, the World Wide Web, and 
electronic commerce, we would expect their attitudes about privacy, if not their 
online behavior, to more closely match those of our sample. 
<P>The table below summarizes the demographic and attitudinal differences 
between our US sample and the Net users in Westin's April 1998 sample.

<P>In the following sections, we present the findings from our survey. We have 
separated this analysis into three sections, the respondents' general attitudes 
about privacy, their attitudes about current and anticipated online practices, 
and their attitudes about privacy regulation. We present each in turn. 
<H2><A name=general></A>General Attitudes about Online Privacy</H2>Overall, our 
respondents registered a high level of concern about privacy in general and on 
the Internet. Only 13% of respondents reported they were "not very" or "not at 
all" concerned. Nonetheless, while the vast majority of our respondents were 
concerned about privacy, their reactions to scenarios involving online data 
collection were extremely varied. Some reported that they would rarely be 
willing to provide personal data online, others showed some willingness to 
provide data depending on the situation, and others were quite willing to 
provide data -- regardless of whether or not they reported a high level of 
concern about privacy. Thus it seems unlikely that a one-size-fits all approach 
to online privacy is likely to succeed. 

<P>In order to understand our respondents' attitudes, we used standard
multivariate clustering techniques to divide our respondents into
three clusters, similar to the clusters Westin (1991) found in his
privacy survey results. Based on general attitudes about privacy as
well as their responses to specific scenarios, the clustering methods
classified 17% of our respondents as <B>privacy fundamentalists</B>,
56% as members of the <B>pragmatic majority</B>, and 27% as
<B>marginally concerned</B>.  We will present each group more fully as
we discuss their data below, but some general characteristics are
important to note. 

<ul>
<li>
The privacy fundamentalists were extremely
concerned about any use of their data and generally unwilling to
provide their data to Web sites, even when privacy protection measures
were in place. They were twice as likely as the other groups to report
having been a victim of an invasion of privacy on the Internet. About
a third of the fundamentalists refused to answer our survey question
about their household income (as compared with 14% of the pragmatists
and 3% of the marginally concerned). 

<li>The pragmatists were also
concerned about data use, but less so than the fundamentalists. They
often had specific concerns and particular tactics for addressing
them. For example, the concerns of pragmatists were often
significantly reduced by the presence of privacy protection measures
such as privacy laws or privacy policies on Web sites. 

<li>The marginally
concerned were generally willing to provide data to Web sites under
almost any condition, although they often expressed a mild general
concern about privacy. Nonetheless, under some conditions, the
marginally concerned seemed to value their privacy.  For example, they
highly rated the ability to have themselves removed from marketing
mailing lists.
</ul>

<H4>Demographic differences</H4>

Westin (1998) and others have found demographic differences, although
weak, among groups with different levels of concern about online
privacy. For example, Westin found that 87% of female Internet users
were very concerned about threats to their personal privacy while only
76% of male Internet users were very concerned. Furthermore, he found
that women registered higher levels of concern about every
privacy-related issue they were questioned about. Although we found no
statistically significant differences based on gender or other
demographics within our sample, the trends in our data were consistent
with Westin's findings.

<H2><A name=practices></A>Attitudes about Current and Anticipated Online 
Information Practices</H2>

Our survey included 14 questions that explored four different
scenarios in which the user is asked to provide personal information
to Web sites. We asked our respondents whether they would type in the
requested information in each situation. We also asked our respondents
how comfortable they generally feel providing each of 12 specific
pieces of information to Web sites, and we asked for feedback on tools
for protecting online privacy. Based on the responses to these
questions we made a number of observations about current and
anticipated online information practices.  <H3>Internet users are more
likely to provide information when they are not identified</H3>We
presented respondents with two scenarios in which the first part of
each scenario described a situation in which a Web site requested only
information that was not personally identifiable. The second part of
each scenario described the same situation, but this time the Web site
also asked for personally identifiable information. In both cases
respondents were much less willing to provide information when
personally identifiable information was requested.

<P>In a scenario involving a banking Web site, 58% of respondents said
they would provide information about their income, investments, and
investment goals in order to receive customized investment
advice. However only 35% said they would also supply their name and
address so that they could receive an investment guide booklet by
mail.

<P>In a scenario about a news, weather, and sports Web site, 84% of
respondents said they would provide their zip code and answer
questions about their interests in order to receive customized
information. But only 49% said they would provide information if they
were also required to provide their name.

<CENTER>
<P><IMG 
alt="Graph: Respondents who probably or definitely would provide requested information" 
src="graph1.gif"></CENTER>

<H3>Some types of data are more sensitive than others</H3>

As mentioned above, we asked respondents how comfortable they feel
providing each of 12 specific pieces of information to Web sites. We
also asked them how comfortable they would be if a child in their care
between the ages of 8 and 12 were asked to provide this
information.<p>

We found significant differences in comfort level across
the various types of information. Not surprisingly, the vast majority
of respondents said they were always or usually comfortable providing
information about their own preferences, including favorite television
show (82%) and favorite snack food (80%). A large number also said
they were always or usually comfortable providing their email address
(76%), age (69%), or information about their computer (63%). About
half said they were always or usually comfortable providing their full
name (54%) or their postal address (44%). Few said they were always or
usually comfortable providing information about their health (18%) or
income (17%), or phone number (11%). None of the respondents said they
were always comfortable providing their credit card number or social
security number, and only a very small number said they would usually
feel comfortable providing credit card number (3%) or social security
number (1%). 

<p>Respondents were consistently less comfortable allowing a
child to provide each of these types of information than they would be
providing it themselves, with the biggest differences reported in the
number of respondents who said they were always or usually comfortable
with a child providing email address (16%) and age (14%). 

<CENTER>
<P><IMG 
alt="Graph: Respondents who are always or usually comfortable providing information" 
src="graph2.gif"></CENTER>

<p>While each of our clusters reported different levels of comfort,
the relative sensitivity to each type of data was consistent across
clusters. That is the members of each cluster held similar views about
which types of data were the most and least sensitive.

<P>It is interesting to note the differences in sensitivity to seemingly similar 
kinds of data. For example, while postal mail address, phone number, and email 
address can all be used to contact someone, most of our respondents said they 
would never or rarely feel comfortable providing their phone number but would 
usually or always feel comfortable providing their email address. The comfort 
level for postal mail address fell somewhere in between. We suspect this may 
have to do with different levels of annoyance related to unsolicited 
communications in each medium as well as the availability of coping strategies 
to deal with this annoyance (Culnan 1993). For example, Westin (1991) found 
people were much more likely to describe marketing solicitations as an invasion 
of privacy when the solicitation was conducted via phone calls than when it was 
conducted via postal mail. 
<P>We also suspect that awareness of problems associated with divulging 
different types of information may affect the level of concern. Publicity 
surrounding identity theft and credit card fraud may have raised awareness about 
the dangers of social security numbers and credit card numbers falling into the 
wrong hands. But there has been less publicity about the dangers associated with 
disclosure of medical records. This may account for the fact that the concern 
reported about credit cards and social security numbers is significantly higher 
than that for medical records -- which could be argued to be just as sensitive. 
<H3>Many factors are important in decisions about information disclosure</H3>Web 
site privacy policies include a wide range of privacy practice details. A number 
of efforts have tried to find ways of highlighting critical points of these 
policies for users. For example, initially the TRUSTe privacy seal program 
offered three seals that varied according to policies on sharing information 
with other parties. The P3P specification includes a vocabulary for encoding 
these practices in a standard way. Even so, it is unclear how to best (1) 
display these practices in a way that users can quickly evaluate the practices 
and (2) design a user interface that&nbsp; permits users to configure an 
automated tool for evaluating those practices. Consequently, we asked 
respondents "If you could configure your Web browser to look for privacy 
policies and privacy seals of approval on Web sites and let you know when you 
were visiting a site whose privacy practices might not be acceptable to you, 
which criteria would be most important to you?" We also asked respondents to 
rate each of 10 criteria as very important, somewhat important, or not 
important. 
<P>Our respondents rated the sharing of their information with other companies 
and organizations as the most important factor. Ninety-six percent of 
respondents said this factor was very or somewhat important, including 79% who 
said it was very important.
 
<P>Three other criteria emerged as highly important factors: (1)
whether information is used in an identifiable way, (2) the kind of
information collected, and (3) the purpose for which the information
is collected. All of these criteria were rated as very important by at
least 69% of respondents and had the same level of importance
statistically.

<P>These top criteria are consistent with the findings of other
surveys. For example, the GVU survey (1998) asked respondents about
seven factors that might influence whether they would give demographic
information to a Web site. The factors most often selected by
respondents were "if a statement was provided regarding how the
information was going to be used," "if a statement was provided
regarding what information was being collected," and "if the data
would only be used in aggregate form." Providing data in exchange for
access to Web pages, product discounts, value-added service, or other
terms and conditions were less popular options. The top reason
respondents gave for not filling out online registration forms at
sites&nbsp; was "information is not provided on how the data is going
to be used."
 
<P>We found three additional criteria that were also very important
factors: (1) whether a site is run by a trusted company or
organization, (2) whether a site will allow people to find out what
information about them is stored in their databases, and (3) whether
the site will remove someone from their mailing lists upon
request. These criteria were rated as very important by at least 62%
of respondents and had the same level of importance
statistically. Interestingly, while none of these criteria were among
the top factors for our privacy fundamentalist or pragmatic majority
clusters, whether the site will remove someone from their mailing
lists upon request was the number one most important factor for our
marginally concerned cluster.

<P>The remaining three criteria were rated as important, but considerably less 
so than the other factors. Not many people rated as very important whether a 
site posts a privacy policy (49%), whether a site has a privacy seal of approval 
(39%) and whether a site discloses a data retention policy (32%). These three 
factors were the least important factors for all three clusters of respondents. 
<CENTER>
<P><IMG alt="Graph: Respondents who consider factor very important" 
src="graph3.gif"></CENTER>
<P>The lack of enthusiasm for knowing whether or not a site posts a privacy 
policy suggests that it is not enough for people to know <I>whether</I> a 
privacy policy is present -- it is more important to know what the policy 
states. The lack of interest in knowing whether a site has a privacy seal of 
approval may be indicative of a lack of understanding of privacy seals (which 
will be discussed later). 
<P>The lack of concern for knowing whether a site discloses a data retention 
policy appears to be due to a distrust that companies will actually remove 
people from their databases and a belief that it will be impossible to remove 
information from all the databases it may have propagated to. Typical comments 
from our respondents were skeptical: "It doesn't take long for this information 
to get spread around and a lot of this might have already been done," "too late: 
the damage would already be done," "who knows where they would sell my address 
to in the mean time," "once you get on a mailing list, you're on many mailing 
lists," and "maybe they wouldn't take me off. How would I know?" 
<P>Likewise, one of our scenario questions asked respondents whether they would 
be more or less likely to provide data to a Web site if it had a privacy policy 
that explained that their information would be removed from the site's database 
if they did not return to the site for three months. Seventy-eight percent of 
respondents said that such a retention policy would not influence them in any 
way. Five percent said they would be less likely to provide information in that 
case (their comments suggested they viewed having their information removed from 
the database as an inconvenience should they return to the site after three 
months), and 17% said that such a retention policy would make them more likely 
to provide information. But other factors such as the existence of privacy 
policies, privacy seals, and privacy laws appeared to be much more influential 
than retention policies. 

<H3>Acceptance of the use of persistent identifiers varies according to their 
purpose</H3>

Some Internet users are concerned that their online
activities may be tracked over time. This can be accomplished using
persistent identifiers stored on a users computer. These are often
referred to as cookies. When asked about Web cookies, 52% of our
respondents indicated they were concerned about them (and another 12%
said they were uncertain about what a cookie is). Of those who knew
what cookies were, 56% said they had changed their cookie settings to
something other than accepting all cookies without warning.

<P>Comments to our free response questions suggest considerable confusion about 
cookies among our respondents. For example many respondents seemed to believe 
that cookies could cause identifying information about them to be sent 
automatically to Web sites. One respondent wrote, "cookies can determine my 
identity from visiting the site," and another wrote "I may have a false sense of 
security but I understand that as long as I accept 'no cookies' the site 
managers cannot access my email address and other personal information." Others 
understood that cookies need not be used to extract personal information from 
them, but did not seem to understand that cookies could be used to track their 
behavior. One respondent wrote, "A cookie can only provide information I have 
already given, so what is the harm?" Still another was simply confused: "I am 
not quite sure what cookie is, but I have an idea." 

<P>We also included three scenario questions in which we described the
use of persistent user identification numbers that browsers could
automatically send back to Web sites on return visits. While the
behavior we described could be implemented using cookies, we did not
refer to cookies in these questions. In a scenario in which a site
uses a persistent identifier to provide a customized service, 78% of
respondents said they would definitely or probably agree to the site
assigning them such an identifier. When we indicated the identifier
would be used to provide customized advertising, 60% of respondents
said they would definitely or probably agree to the site assigning
them an identifier. But when we indicated that the identifier would be
used to provide customized advertising across many Web sites, only 44%
of respondents said they would definitely or probably agree to using
such an identifier. We found similar trends across all three clusters
of respondents.  Thus it appears that most of our respondents are not
opposed to the use of persistent identifiers or state management
mechanisms such as cookies; however, many have misconceptions about
these technologies and concerns about some of their uses.

<CENTER>
<P><IMG

<H3>Internet users dislike automatic data transfer</H3>

In the survey, we also described a number of browser features that
would make it easier to provide information to Web sites and asked
respondents which features they would use. We found that while our
respondents said they are interested in tools that make using the Web
more convenient, most do not want these tools to transfer information
about them to Web sites automatically.

<P>The most popular feature we described was an "auto-fill" button
that users could click on their browsers to have information they had
already provided to another Web site automatically filled in to the
appropriate fields in a Web form. Sixty-one percent of our respondents
said they would be interested in such a feature, while 51% said they
would be interested in a similar feature that would automatically fill
out forms at sites that have the same privacy policies as other sites
the user had provided information to (no button click would be
necessary to activate the auto-fill). Both of these features would
require a user to click a submit button before any information was
actually transferred to a Web site. Thirty-nine percent of respondents
said they would be interested in a feature that automatically sent
information they had provided to a Web site back on a return visit.
 
<P>However, there was little interest in two features that would
automatically send information to Web sites without any user
intervention: a feature that notified the user that it had sent the
information was of interest to 14% of respondents, and a feature that
provided no indication that it had transferred data was of interest to
only 6%. Thus 86% of our respondents reported no interest in features
that would automatically transfer their data to Web sites without any
user intervention.

<CENTER>
<P><IMG alt="Graph: Respondents who would use proposed browser features" 
src="graph5.gif"></CENTER>

<p>Respondents in our privacy fundamentalist cluster had much less
interest in any of the described features than the members of the
other clusters -- only about one-fourth of the privacy fundamentalists
were interested in any of the features. However, even the marginally
concerned cluster members had little interest in features that would
automatically transfer their data to Web sites without any user
intervention -- only 12% of the marginally concerned were interested
in a feature that transferred data without notification.


<P>These findings are consistent with other surveys that found Web users value 
privacy over convenience. For example, on the GVU survey (1998) 78% of 
respondents said privacy is more important to them than convenience. Our 
findings demonstrate how this concern plays out over specific technical 
features. 
<P>Our respondents provided strong comments about automatic data transfer. A 
large number of respondents made comments about wanting to remain in control 
over their information and stating that they had no desire for automatic data 
transfer. Some respondents were concerned with the perils of automatic data 
transfer in general. For example, one respondent noted that "I want to be in 
charge of all information sent to other companies. Just because they are 
similar, doesn't mean I [want] my information shared with them." Another noted 
the need for updating personal information: "To be able to update or correct the 
previous info is a good thing." However, most comments revolved around the 
respondents' desire to maintain control of the process. For example: "Auto[matic] 
features save time. &#8230;However, I do like to know when information about me is 
being transmitted," "I want to be in control of what is done. This way I know 
what was done," and "I don't want anything sent automatically. I want to check 
out everything I am applying for." 
<H3>Internet users dislike unsolicited communications</H3>

On several questions, respondents displayed a desire not to receive
unsolicited communications resulting from the provision of information
to Web sites. For example, after describing a scenario in which a Web
site would offer visitors free pamphlets and coupons, we asked
respondents whether they would be more or less likely to provide
information to the same Web site with a new condition. Specifically we
described a site that had a privacy policy that permitted the site to
send periodic updates on products <I>and</I> to share identifiable
information with other companies that sold products of potential
interest. Sixty-one percent of respondents who said they would provide
their information to receive pamphlets and coupons said they would be
less likely to provide that information if it would be shared for
future marketing. However, nearly half of those respondents said they
would be more likely to provide the information if the site offered a
way to get off their mailing list in the future.

<P>The reasons for this were obvious in the written comments. As one respondent 
noted, ""I already get too much junk mail." Others expressed concerns about 
unsolicited marketing: "I would not want to have telemarketers, email messages, 
direct mail, etc. coming as I get too much of that anyway." and "I don't mind 
receiving literature that I request, but I DO NOT like to receive unsolicited 
mail, e-mail or phone calls." 
<P>While respondents indicated a clear dislike for unsolicited communications, 
they were less concerned (but not unconcerned) about unsolicited email. As 
discussed earlier, respondents were more comfortable providing their email 
address than they were their postal address or their phone number. Furthermore, 
they expressed less concern about unsolicited email and about Web sites 
collecting email addresses for marketing lists than they did about Web sites 
collecting personal information from children, or someone tracking what Web 
sites people visit and using that information improperly. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>In the previous sections, we have presented findings about the respondents' 
attitudes about current information practices. We found a number of "hot" 
issues, such as whether they can be identified and the sensitivity of the data 
items to the individual. We also found a number of important differences in how 
our privacy clusters (privacy fundamentalists, privacy pragmatics, and privacy 
unconcerned) weighed these criteria. We also presented findings suggesting that 
there are some surprising similarities: People do not like unsolicited 
communications, they can be tolerant of persistent identifiers, and they dislike 
automatic transfer, although the degree of preference varies among the 
respondent clusters. 
<P>In this next section, we present our results about respondents' views of 
privacy regulation. 
<H2><A name=regulation></A>Attitudes about Privacy Regulation and 
Self-Regulation</H2>
<H3>A joint program of privacy policies and privacy seals seemingly provides a 
comparable level of user confidence as that provided by privacy laws</H3>We 
described a scenario in which a Web site with interesting information related to 
a hobby asks for a visitor's name and postal address in 
order to provide free pamphlets and coupons. Seventy-three percent of 
respondents said they definitely or probably would provide that information 
under those circumstances. We then asked whether they would be more or less 
likely to provide the information: 
<OL>
  <LI>if there was a law that prevented the site from using the information for 
  any purpose other than processing the request 
  <LI>if the site had a privacy policy that said the information would be used 
  only to process the request, and 
  <LI>if the site had both a privacy policy and a seal of approval from a 
  well-known organization such as the Better Business Bureau or the AAA. 
</LI></OL>While 28% of respondents who were uncertain or said they would not 
provide the information said they would be more likely to provide the 
information if the site had a privacy policy, 48% said they would be more likely 
if there was a relevant law, and 58% said they would be more likely if the site 
had both a privacy policy and a seal of approval. This suggests that the comfort 
gained from a joint program of privacy policies and privacy seals may be at 
least as much as that gained from a privacy law. Note that our scenario involved 
a Web site that requested name and postal address information; it is unclear 
whether we would find the same results in a scenario involving more sensitive 
information. 
<H3>People do not seem to understand privacy seal programs</H3>While a large 
number of respondents said they would be more likely to provide information in a 
scenario where a Web site had a privacy policy and a seal of approval, privacy 
seals were among the least important criteria for determining whether or not to 
provide information to Web sites. 
There are several potential reasons for this. It is important to note that in 
the scenario question we mentioned two specific well-known organizations as 
possible seal providers: the Better Business Bureau and AAA. We made no such 
mention in the criteria question. Efforts to date to raise consumer awareness of 
privacy seal programs have been minimal, and it is likely that respondents are 
not sufficiently familiar with the concept of online privacy seal programs that 
they consider them meaningful unless they are linked to a familiar trusted 
organization. If that is the case, it indicates that the proponents of such 
programs need to do more to educate consumers. 
<P>A number of respondents commented that they would like to know whether or not 
sites actually follow their privacy policies, suggesting that they were unaware 
that seals can help provide assurance that policies are followed. Some 
commentators did understand this, but wanted to know how they could be assured 
that the seal was authentic. 
<P>A number of respondents commented that they would trust a seal from a trusted 
third-party. In the question, one of the third-party examples was the Better 
Business Bureau. Typical comments included: "I trust the BBB, etc.," "The BBB is 
very thorough in their recommendation of sites,"&nbsp; and "[the] Better 
business Bureau has a reputation of protecting the consumer and being 
responsible for investigating companies, thus, I trust their seal." However 
there were some skeptics, who suggest how easy it might be to lose consumers' 
trust. "The Better Business Bureau doesn't have any REAL POWER [sic] over a 
business...." wrote one respondent. In general, however, seals were perceived as 
a positive influence in maintaining privacy, as one respondent explained: "This 
affiliation gives them more credibility and believability as far as I'm 
concerned. I would check with the reference before I gave the information if it 
was information that was more personal." 
<H2><A name=tech></A>Technical Implications</H2>As the software engineering 
community attempts to implement P3P or similar privacy protocols, one of the 
major issues will be the design of easy-to-use interfaces for users. Users would likely 
benefit from systems that assist them in identifying situations where a site's 
privacy practices is counter to their interest and assisting them in reaching 
agreement and exchanging data where such an interaction is acceptable to the 
user. 
<P>However, a user interface must not only present an extremely complex 
information and decision space, it must do so seamlessly and without a 
distracting interface (Ackerman and Cranor, 1999). If a person wishes to 
control what information she presents to whom, this results in an enormous 
information space (i.e. each datum a person has about herself against each 
person or organizational entity with which she comes into contact). Moreover, 
the space is actually more complex, since there are additional dimensions to 
information dissemination, as noted in the P3P specification (e.g., purpose, 
access). Obviously, a matrix-style user interface for private information over 
each of its ten dimensions would be overwhelming for most users. However, 
properly designed and abstracted interfaces or borrowed settings (Cranor and 
Reagle 1997) may help. 
<P>One of our goals for this survey was to investigate consumer-driven design 
issues in privacy protocols and their user clients. We found several items of 
interest in considering the feasibility of P3P or any other privacy protocol: 
<UL>
  <LI>The cluster of privacy fundamentalists and marginally concerned may find 
  extremely simplified interfaces to be adequate for their purposes. For 
  example, a privacy fundamentalist may only want to release information under a 
  small number of circumstances, such as when sites use information only for 
  completing a purchasing transaction. A marginally concerned user would only 
  need to specify those few (already constrained) instances in which she would 
  not permit information collection practices. However, the pragmatists (who are 
  the majority of users) will require more sophisticated and varied interface 
  mechanisms to be most at ease. This cluster of users employs many strategies 
  across a wide range of finely weighed situations. It is unlikely that a highly 
  simplified interface will satisfy them. 
  <LI>Automatic transfer of data and computerized negotiations with sites are 
  unlikely to be interesting to most consumers. 
  <LI>Designers should permit users to have differing views of -- or ways of 
  looking at -- their information. For instance, while it makes sense to include 
  phone number in a contact information category, our respondents considered it 
  to be more sensitive than postal information. Consequently, a user should be 
  able to enter contact information on one page, but be able to drag those 
  pieces of information to different sensitivity buckets or to simply manipulate 
  information as grouped by sensitivity. 
  <LI>Additional augmentative assistance to consumers will be useful. Many of 
  our respondents expressed confusion over potential risks and rewards for their 
  dissemination of personal information. Having agents that help users (e.g., 
  that provide warnings based on third-party databases of rogue sites) could 
  well be helpful instead of placing the full burden on users themselves. 
  <LI>Finally, technical mechanisms clearly have limitations. Our respondents 
  were very aware (and vocal) about these limitations. </LI></UL>
<H2><A name=policy></A>Policy and Business Implications</H2>What do our results 
say to those concerned with public policy? Our findings show that users are 
indeed concerned about privacy. Do our results argue that present day laws and 
self-regulatory programs are mitigating that concern? Not necessarily. 

<P>Our results do permit us to compare assumptions made about Internet
users' approaches to privacy with the responses of actual users. For
instance, present day US public policy does make a distinction between
children and adults, and this seems well founded on the basis of our
results. We also found that our respondents cared a great deal about
the perceived trustworthiness of the data collecting organization, the
purpose of the data collection, and its redistribution
policies. Proposed policy solutions need to squarely address each of
these topics. Seemingly, much of the discomfort with the Web today
results from not knowing, or not trusting the information practices of
a site.  As Hine and Eve point out:

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Our research showed that, in the absence of straightforward 
  explanations on the purposes of data collection, people were able to produce 
  their own versions of the organization's motivation that were unlikely to be 
  favorable. Clear and readily available explanations might alleviate some of 
  the unfavorable speculation" (Hine and Eve 1998, 261).</BLOCKQUOTE>

If we wish 
to raise the comfort level, we must ensure users are informed and can trust 
whatever policies are disclosed. If we wish to be pragmatic, we must focus on 
those things about which users say they are most concerned. These results 
provide evidence of what those concerns are among an Internet savvy 
population. We must echo Milne and Boza's conclusions:
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The data from these studies suggest that a
trust-enhancement
  approach is more effective. Trust can be enhanced by building a reputation for 
  fairness, by communication information sharing policies up front and stressing 
  the relational benefits, and by constantly informing the consumers of the 
  organization's activities to serve them better." (Milne and Boza
1998).</BLOCKQUOTE>

Several important caveats and considerations remain. For example,
although privacy advocates consider access to be an important principle, for
whatever reason, the ability to access data was rated less importantly
by our respondents than several of the other factors.  Thus, the
pursuit of this goal in the policy arena might be treated differently
from the more highly rated factors. We are not arguing that the
pursuit of the information access principle is useless nor that merely
more effort is required. Our results do not speak to whether the low
expectations about access to information should or could be raised in
priority -- the data can only argue that access is presently
considered to be less important by our respondents.

<P>Additionally, to meet the needs of the varied clusters of people,
public policy should support flexibility. Both the technical (P3P) and
self-regulatory (TRUSTe, BBBOnline) approaches promote privacy
practice disclosure upon which users can make their own
decisions. However, while users do care very much about some
information practices, our respondents placed relatively little value
in the presence of Web site privacy proposals or privacy seals. In
light of this, a technical approach like P3P is compelling because it
permits flexibility and enables users' preferences to be acted upon
without requiring too much of their attention. Otherwise, we may have
to rely upon an approach of (1) continued discomfort and confusion or
(2) a one-size-fits-all legal approach. Regardless, we acknowledge
that an eventual solution might rely upon elements of legal,
self-regulatory, and technical approaches to the problem.

<P>Finally, we must caution that policy based solely on survey results is 
inadequate. People's self-reported preferences often do not match their real 
world behavior (Turner and Martin 1984). Indeed, we found notable mismatches in 
our results. For example, while 39% of respondents said they are very concerned 
about online privacy, only half the members of that group were classified as 
privacy fundamentalists based on their responses to our scenario questions. More 
importantly, one would not want to base public policy solely on user 
expectations. 
<P>Policy making based solely on survey results can be described as 
<I>self-deprecating</I>: if the standard of what constitutes reasonable privacy 
is based on people's expectations, the standard and expectations are mutually 
influencing, resulting in a downward trend. This characteristic was reflected in 
some of our discussions with students, where they did not feel concerned because 
they had no other choice, concern would only be frustrating or futile. 
Nonetheless, we believe that present day public policy can only improve with 
more concrete data about users' actual attitudes and expectations of online 
privacy -- if for no other reason to understand the ways in which people's 
expectations change over time.
