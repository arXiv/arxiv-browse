In this paper, we show that estimates of the correlation dimension grow rapidly with increasing noise level in the time-series, while estimates of the limit capacity remain relatively unaffected. It is therefore proposed that the limit capacity be used in studies of noisy data, despite its heavier computational requirements. An analysis of Singapore wind data with the limit capacity estimate revealed a surprisingly low dimension (~2.5). It is suggested that further studies be made with comprehensive equatorial weather data.',NULL,1,1202001145,1,0);

The method is based on partitioning the state space of dynamical systems with invariant sets, which form cells representing locations of the timed automata. To enable verification of the dynamical system based on the abstraction, conditions for obtaining sound, complete, and refinable abstractions are set up. It is proposed to partition the state space utilizing sub-level sets of Lyapunov functions, since they are positive invariant sets. The existence of sound abstractions for Morse-Smale systems and complete and refinable abstractions for linear systems are proved.','http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1282262445,1,0);
