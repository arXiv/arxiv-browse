Atomic spontaneous decay exhibits vacuum-field Rabi oscillations -- a principal signature of strong atom-vacuum-field coupling. The strongly coupled atomic state is nothing but a ''quasi-1D cavity polariton''. Its stability is mainly determined by the atom-nanotube van der Waals interaction.

The generalization of the optical theorem is derived for the case when an absorption potential is present in the Hamiltonian. With this theorem the annihilation cross section is fully determined by scattering amplitudes. This allows us to separate out analytically the contribution of the positronium formation from the overall annihilation cross section. The rest is determined as the direct annihilation cross section. It is done uniformly below as well as above the positronium formation threshold. The multichannel three-body theory for scattering states in the presence of an imaginary absorption potential is developed in order to compute the direct $e^+ e^-$ annihilation amplitude. Special attention has been paid to an accurate definition of the coordinate part of the absorption potential as the properly constructed zero-range potential, which corresponds to the delta-function originated from the first order perturbation theory. The calculated direct annihilation cross section below the positronium formation threshold is in good agreement with results of other authors. The direct annihilation cross section computed with the formalism of the paper shows nonsingular behavior at the positronium formation threshold and is in good agreement with existing data. A number of $e^+ e^-$ direct annihilation cross sections and positronium formation cross sections in the energy gap between Ps$(1s)$ and H$(n=2)$ thresholds are reported. A sharp increase in the calculated direct annihilation cross section across the resonant energy is found for all first S and P-wave Feshbach resonances.',NULL,1,1296694967,1,0),(598777,420058,'hep-th/0703166','2007-03-19 06\:14\:12','2009-12-01 08\:56\:29',58699,'Hironobu Kihara','kihara@sci.osaka-cu.ac.jp',7662,'tex','1','A Classical Solution in Six-dimensional Gauge Theory with Higher Derivative Coupling','Hironobu Kihara, Muneto Nitta','hep-th','7 pages',NULL,'OCU-PHYS 261',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'  We show that the spin connection of the standard metric on a six-dimensional sphere gives an exact solution to the generalized self-dual equations suggested by Tchrakian some years ago.

We study numerically and, in part, analytically different bifurcation structures. Particularly interesting is the description of the abrupt transition order-to-chaos mediated by an attractor made of an infinite number of limit cycles with only a finite number of different periods. It is shown that the power-law piece in the map is at the origin of this type of bifurcation. The system exhibits interior crises and crisis-induced intermittency.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',4,1252511988,0,0),(754273,526690,'0901.0022','2008-12-30 22\:18\:58','2009-12-01 11\:41\:18',38275,'Christopher D.

This leads to some new phenomena, including the appearance of intermediate spaces of \"semi-classical\" automorphic forms; this gives a hierarchy of interpolation spaces (eigenvarieties) interpolating classical automorphic forms satisfying different finite slope conditions (corresponding to a choice of parabolic subgroup of G at p).\n  The construction of these spaces relies on methods of locally analytic representation theory, combined with the theory of compact operators on Banach modules. Using a result of Owen Jones relating the representation at a locally algebraic weight to a Verma module, I also prove an analogue in this situation of Coleman''s theorem that forms of small slope are classical, implying that the eigenvarieties I construct contain a dense set of points corresponding to classical eigenforms.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1232067605,0,0),(759646,530481,'0901.3666','2009-01-23 12\:36\:10','2009-12-01 11\:46\:07',12227,'Fabio Musso','musso@fis.uniroma3.it',514507,'tex',NULL,'A Markov chain version of the Eigen model','Fabio Musso','q-bio.PE','18 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Journal of Theoretical Biology',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'  We exhibit a stochastic discrete time model that has the Eigen model as its deterministic continuous limit.

This paper is primarily aimed at investigation of the Chandler wobble (CW) at the whole available 163-year interval to search for the major CW amplitude and phase variations. First, the CW signal was extracted from the IERS (International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service) Pole coordinates time series using two digital filters\: the singular spectrum analysis and Fourier transform. The CW amplitude and phase variations were examined by means of the wavelet transform and Hilbert transform. Results of our analysis have shown that, besides the well-known CW phase jump in the 1920s, two other large phase jumps have been found in the 1850s and 2000s.

The six-dimensional time-dependent transfer equation is difficult to solve unless the problem is in equilibrium or highly symmetric. When the radiation field is smooth, it is natural to take angular moments of the transfer equation to reduce the degrees of freedom. However, low-order moment equations contain terms that depend on higher-order moments. To close the system of moment equations, approximations are made to truncate this hierarchy. Popular closures used in astrophysics include flux limited diffusion and the M_1 closure, which are rather ad hoc and do not necessarily to capture the correct physics. In this paper, we propose a new closure scheme for radiative transfer. We start from a different perspective and highlight the consistency of a fully relativistic formalism. By employing the fact that photons do not self-interact, we conclude that a physical closure should be linear in the high-order Landau-Lifshitz frame. We then derive a general framework to approximate radiative transfer to arbitrary order based on relativistic Grad''s moment method. This framework goes beyond the grey approximation even though the moments are frequency integrated. Together with the requirement that photon transport is reference frame independent, we are able to reduce the equations to second order. Finally, we discuss the detail mathematical structure and physical properties of the derived closure schemes.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1259629201,0,0),(837134,589496,'0912.1955','2009-12-10 17\:05\:29','2010-01-07 21\:32\:14',15360,'Adriaan Schakel','schakel@zedat.fu-berlin.de',16542,'tex',NULL,'Derivation of the effective action of a dilute Fermi gas in the unitary limit of the BCS-BEC crossover','Adriaan M.

We integrate the geodesic deviation equation in tandem with the N-body equations of motion, demonstrating that this can produce numerically converged results for the properties of fine-grained phase-space streams and their associated caustics, even in the inner regions of haloes. Our effective resolution for such structures is many orders of magnitude better than achieved by conventional techniques on even the largest simulations. We apply these methods to the six Milky Way-mass haloes of the Aquarius Project. At 8 kpc from halo centre a typical point intersects about 10^14 streams with a very broad range of individual densities; the ~10^6 most massive streams contribute about half of the local dark matter density. As a result, the velocity distribution of dark matter particles should be very smooth with the most massive fine-grained stream contributing about 0.1% of the total signal. Dark matter particles at this radius have typically passed 200 caustics since the Big Bang, with a 5 to 95% range of 50 to 500. Such caustic counts are a measure of the total amount of dynamical mixing and are very robustly determined by our technique. The peak densities on present-day caustics in the inner halo almost all lie well below the mean local dark matter density. As a result caustics provide a negligible boost (<0.1%) to the predicted local dark matter annihilation rate. The effective boost is larger in the outer halo but never exceeds about 10%. Thus fine-grained streams and their associated caustics have no effect on the detectability of dark matter, either directly in Earth-bound laboratories, or indirectly through annihilation radiation.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1266454802,0,0),(860483,602205,'1002.3157','2010-02-17 17\:09\:49','2010-02-26 11\:50\:54',74728,'Vern Paulsen','vern@math.uh.edu',6111,'tex','1','Syndetic Sets and Amenability','Vern I.

The dynamics of these models can be fully described by scalar evolution equations that can be given in the form of a proper dynamical system associated with a 4-dimensional phase space whose critical points and invariant subspaces are examined and classified. The phase space evolution of various configurations is studied in detail by means of two 2-dimensional subspaces\: a projection into the invariant homogeneous subspace associated with Lambda-CDM solutions with FLRW metric, and a projection into a subspace generated by suitably defined fluctuations that convey the effects of inhomogeneity. We look at cases with perpetual expansion, bouncing and loitering behavior, as well as configurations with \"mixed\" kinematic patters, such as a collapsing region in an expanding background. In all cases, phase space trajectories emerge from and converge to stable past and future attractors in a qualitatively analogous way as in the case of the FLRW limit.

A study on performance difference between Fixed Priority schedulers and EDF in the case of partitioning scheduling is also considered.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1296694906,1,0),(878063,543985,'0904.1234','2010-04-23 02\:53\:29','2011-02-03 01\:00\:49',104656,'Mark Herrera','herrera.mark@gmail.com',692688,'tex','','Mapping the evolution of scientific fields','Mark Herrera, David C.

Owing to its power-law temporal decay and power-law spectrum, it seems likely that the high-energy emission is from the forward-shock energizing the ambient medium (the standard blast-wave model for GRB afterglows), the GeV flux and its decay rate being consistent with that model''s expectations. However, the synchrotron emission from a collimated outflow (the standard jet model) has difficulties in accounting for the lower-energy afterglow emission, where a simultaneous break occurs in the optical and X-ray light-curves at 2 ks, but with the optical flux decay (before and after the break) being much slower than in the X-rays (at same time). The measured X-ray and GeV fluxes are incompatible with the higher-energy afterglow emission being from same spectral component as the lower-energy afterglow emission, which suggests a synchrotron self-Compton model for this afterglow. Cessation of energy injection in the blast-wave can account for the optical and X-ray light-curves provided that the ambient medium has a wind-like n propto r^{-2} density.

The non-Gaussian mass function has been calculated by several authors in different ways, typically by exploiting the smallness of certain parameters which naturally appear in the calculation, to set up a perturbative expansion. We improve upon the existing results for the mass function by combining path integral methods and saddle point techniques (which have been separately applied in previous approaches). Additionally, we carefully account for the various scale dependent combinations of small parameters which appear. Some of these combinations in fact become of order unity for large mass scales and at high redshifts, and must therefore be treated non-perturbatively. Our approach allows us to do this, and to also account for multi-scale density correlations which appear in the calculation. We thus derive an accurate expression for the mass function which is based on approximations that are valid over a larger range of mass scales and redshifts than those of other authors. By tracking the terms ignored in the analysis, we estimate theoretical errors for our result and also for the results of others. We also discuss the complications introduced by the choice of smoothing filter function, which we take to be a top-hat in real space, and which leads to the dominant errors in our expression.

Such a system also has profound implications for quantum information processing, serving as a long-term memory that can store the full quantum information contained in an optical pulse.

For a power law size-wavelength scaling of $r_s\\propto\\lambda^{p}$, we were able to constrain the value of the exponent to $p=1.3\\pm0.3$ for both $r^{R}_s$ priors, which is in agreement with the temperature profiles of simple thin disk models.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1282521619,0,0),(912127,589496,'0912.1955','2010-08-19 21\:08\:25','2011-02-03 01\:02\:34',15360,'Adriaan Schakel','schakel@zedat.fu-berlin.de',19598,'tex','','Derivation of the effective action of a dilute Fermi gas in the unitary limit of the BCS-BEC crossover','Adriaan M.

We argue that such spherical voids should be treated only as a gross first approximation to configurations that follow from a suitable smoothing out of the non--spherical part of the inhomogeneities on angular scales. In this Letter we present a non-spherical inhomogeneous and anisotropic model that supports the above statement and, at the same time, addresses the limitations of spherical inhomogeneities. By using a thin-shell approximation to the quasi--spherical Szekeres solution, we construct a model of evolving cosmic structures, containing several elongated supercluster-like structures with underdense regions between them, which altogether provides a reasonable coarse-grained description of realistic structures. While this configuration is not spherically symmetric, its proper volume average yields a spherical void profile of 250 Mpc that roughly agrees with observations. Also, by considering a non-spherical inhomogeneity, the definition of a \"center\" location becomes more nuanced, and thus the constraints placed by fitting observations on our position with respect to this location become less restrictive.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1282521636,0,0),(912466,636644,'1008.3611','2010-08-21 07\:24\:53','2011-02-03 01\:02\:00',127327,'Alexander Eisfeld','eisfeld@mpipks-dresden.mpg.de',27448,'tex','','Spectral properties of molecular oligomers.

Recent surveys, like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Anglo-Australian Two-degree survey (2dF), have shown that there seems to be a correlation between the clustering of galaxies and their properties such as metallicity and star formation rate, which are believed to be environment-dependent. This environmental dependence is not included in the standard halo model where the host halo mass is the only variable specifying galaxy properties. In our approach, the halo properties i.e., the concentration, and the Halo Occupation Distribution --HOD-- prescription, will not only depend on the halo mass (like in the standard halo model) but also on the halo environment. We examine how different environmental dependence of halo concentration and HOD prescription affect the correlation function. We see that at the level of dark matter clustering, the concentration of haloes does not affect considerably to the dark matter correlation function. However the galaxy correlation function is extremely sensitive to the HOD details, even when only the HOD of a small fraction of haloes is modified. In particular, the galaxy correlation function is most sensitive to the minimum mass for a halo to host a galaxy and the number of satellite galaxies for a given halo mass and environment.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1283126414,0,0),(914987,638227,'1008.5194','2010-08-31 00\:57\:27','2010-09-01 00\:00\:41',16256,'Parsa Bonderson','pbonders@alumni.caltech.edu',238754,'tex','','Plasma Analogy and Non-Abelian Statistics for Ising-type Quantum Hall States','Parsa Bonderson, Victor Gurarie, Chetan Nayak','cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.mes-hall quant-ph','59 pages, 3 figures',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'We study the non-Abelian statistics of quasiparticles in the Ising-type quantum Hall states which are likely candidates to explain the observed Hall conductivity plateaus in the second Landau level, most notably the one at filling fraction nu=5/2.

The effective mass of the hole increases dramatically with a tensile strain, while strain shows a minimal effect on tuning the effective mass of the electron.

Consequently, even the unit charge skyrmion has only discrete symmetry and consists of a bound state of two half lumps. A model of long-range inter-skyrmion forces is developed wherein a unit skyrmion is pictured as a single scalar dipole inducing a massless scalar field tangential to the vacuum manifold. This model has the interesting feature that the two-skyrmion interaction energy depends only on the average orientation of the dipoles relative to the line joining them. Its qualitative predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations. Global energy minimizers of charges B=1,...,14,18,32 are found numerically.

Even when 25% of total area of the survey is masked, the method recovers the E-mode power spectrum at a sub-percent precision over a wide range of multipoles 100<l<10000. The systematic error is smaller than the statistical errors expected for a 2000 square degree survey. The residual B-mode spectrum is well suppressed in the amplitudes at less than a percent level relative to the E-mode.

Such a system also has profound implications for quantum information processing, serving as a long-term memory that can store the full quantum information contained in an optical pulse. Here we suggest a novel approach to light storage involving an optical waveguide coupled to an optomechanical crystal array, where light in the waveguide can be dynamically and coherently transferred into long-lived mechanical vibrations of the array.

We find that a virtual millicharged particle which could explain the muonic Lamb shift discrepancy alters theoretical predictions for the muon anomalous magnetic moment by many standard deviations and therefore is in conflict with experiment. Also, we find no parameterizations of an unstable virtual vector boson which could simultaneously explain both \"muonic\" discrepancies without significantly altering theoretical predictions for electronic hydrogen, where theory and experiment currently are in excellent agreement.

The sample is composed of normal ETGs having effective radii comparable to the mean radius of local ones and of compact ETGs having effective radii from two to six times smaller. We do not find evidence of a dependence of the compactness of ETGs on their stellar mass. We find that the stellar mass of normal ETGs formed at z_form<3 while the stellar content of compact ETGs formed at 2<z_form<10 with a large fraction of them characterized by z_form>5. Earlier stars formed at z_form>5 are assembled in compact and more massive (M_*>10^11 M_sun) ETGs while stars later formed (z_form<3) or resulting from subsequent episodes of star formation are assembled both in compact and normal ETGs. Thus, the older the stellar population the higher the mass of the hosting galaxy but not vice versa. This suggests that the epoch of formation may play a role in the formation of massive ETGs rather than the mass itself. The possible general scheme in which normal <z>~1.5 ETGs are descendants of high-z compact spheroids enlarged through subsequent dry mergers is not compatible with the current models which predict a number of dry mergers two orders of magnitude lower than the one needed. Moreover, we do not find evidence supporting a dependence of the compactness of galaxies on their redshift of assembly. Finally, we propose a simple scheme of formation and assembly of the stellar mass of ETGs based on dissipative gas-rich merger which can qualitatively account for the co-existence of normal and compact ETGs observed at <z>~1.5 in spite of the same stellar mass, the lack of normal ETGs with high z_form and the absence of correlation between compactness, stellar mass and formation redshift.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1290992570,0,0),(943509,656741,'1011.5773','2010-11-26 12\:40\:22','2010-12-01 01\:01\:35',112632,'Matthew Luzum','mluzum@u.washington.edu',26223,'tex','','Collective flow and long-range correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions','Matthew Luzum','nucl-th hep-ph nucl-ex','6 pages, 2 figures',NULL,'Saclay t10/184',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Making use of recently released data on dihadron correlations by the STAR collaboration, I analyze the long-range (\"ridge-like\") part of these data and show that the dependence on both transverse momentum as well as orientation with respect to the event plane are consistent with correlations expected from only collective flow.

We have applied this hierarchical model to optical and NIR data of 127 SN Ia from PAIRITEL, CfA3, CSP, and the literature.

The combination of NIR and optical data constrains the dust extinction and improves the predictive precision of individual SN Ia distances by about 60%. Using cross-validation, we estimate an rms distance modulus prediction error of 0.11 mag for SN with optical and NIR data versus 0.15 mag for SN with optical data alone. Continued study of SN Ia in the NIR is important for improving their utility as precise and accurate cosmological distance indicators.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1292202007,0,0),(945105,652619,'1011.1651','2010-12-01 10\:41\:39','2010-12-02 01\:01\:24',89490,'Agissilaos Athanassoulis','agis.athanassoulis@gmail.com',35599,'pdftex','','Strong and weak semiclassical limits for some rough Hamiltonians','Agissilaos Athanassoulis, Thierry Paul','math.AP',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'We present several results concerning the semiclassical limit of the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation with potentials whose regularity doesn''t guarantee the uniqueness of the underlying classical flow.

Pulsations with a period of 93.737 s were clearly detected in the light curves of the pulsar up to the 80-100 keV energy band. The pulse profile was found to be strongly energy dependent, a double peaked profile at soft X-ray energy bands (< 8 keV) and a single peaked smooth profile at hard X-rays. The broad-band energy spectrum of the pulsar, reported for the first instance in this paper, is well described with three different continuum models viz. (i) a high energy cut-off power-law, (ii) a Negative and Positive power-law with EXponential cut-off (NPEX), and (iii) a partial covering power-law with high energy cut-off. Inspite of large value of absorption column density in the direction of the pulsar, a blackbody component of temperature ~0.17 keV for the soft excess was required for the first two continuum models. A narrow iron K_\\alpha emission line was detected in the pulsar spectrum. The partial covering model, however, is found to explain the phase averaged and phase resolved spectra well. The dip like feature in the pulse profile can be explained by the presence of an additional absorption component with high column density and covering fraction at the same pulse phase.

We determined the intensity ratios of $^{12}$CO($J=3-2$) to $^{13}$CO($J=3-2$), $R^{12/13}_{3-2}$, and $^{13}$CO($J=3-2$) to $^{13}$CO($J=1-0$), $R^{13}_{3-2/1-0}$, at 45$\\arcsec$ resolution. These ratios were used for radiative transfer calculations in order to estimate temperature and density of the clumps.

In this short paper, we wish to point out that the CMG region is the convex hall of three rate regions obtained by different superposition coding strategies corresponding to the same input distributions. In other words, the CMG region specified by a probability distribution is not entirely achievable by a fixed superposition coding strategy in general, rather the region corresponds to time-sharing between three distinct superposition coding strategies. The consequence of this observation is that a fixed power splitting strategy as specified by Etkin et al. does not entirely achieve the capacity region to within one bit.

In particular, we show that the one bit gap is not always attainable, specifically on the corners of the rate region, by using a fixed power splitting scheme. The one-bit gap result is proved by comparing an achievable rate region due to Chong et al. (also known as the CMG region) with new upper bounds for the capacity region derived by Etkin, Tse, and Wang. In this short paper, we wish to point out that the CMG region is the convex hull of three rate regions obtained by different superposition coding strategies corresponding to the same input distributions. In other words, the CMG region specified by a probability distribution is not entirely achievable by a fixed superposition coding strategy in general, rather the region corresponds to time-sharing between three distinct superposition coding strategies. The consequence of this observation is that a fixed power splitting strategy as specified by Etkin et al. does not entirely achieve the capacity region to within one bit. However, we show that the extra rate constraints resulting from using a fixed power splitting strategy are still within a constant gap of the capacity region, but this constant gap could be as large as 2 bits.','http\://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/',2,1426607799,0,0),(958934,666892,'1101.3203','2011-01-17 13\:25\:35','2015-03-17 16\:09\:12',10853,'V.

Here we outline the development of a self-consistent protocol for messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence that provides constraints and guidelines for the construction of a message in order to maximize the probability that the message effectively communicates. A METI protocol considers several factors including signal encoding, message length, information content, anthropocentrism, transmission method, and transmission periodicity. Once developed, the protocol will be released for testing on different human groups worldwide and across cultural boundaries. An effective message to extraterrestrials should at least be understandable by humans, and releasing the protocol for testing will allow us to improve the protocol and develop potential messages. Through an interactive website, users across the world will be able to create and exchange messages that follow the protocol in order to discover the types of messages better suited for cross-cultural communication.

Because of the potential importance of understanding the origin of the ICL in the context of the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe, the field has recently undergone a revival both in the quality and quantity of observational and theoretical investigations. Due to cosmological dimming, the observational work has mostly concentrated on low redshift clusters, but clearly observations at higher redshifts can provide interesting clues about the evolution of the diffuse component. In this paper we present the first results of a program to characterize the ICL of intermediate redshift clusters. We find that at z ~ 0.3, the X-ray cluster RX J0054.0-2823 already has a significant ICL and that the fraction of the total light in the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is comparable to that of similar clusters at lower redshift. We also find that the kinematics of the ICL is consistent with it being the remnant of tidally destroyed galaxies streaming in the central regions of the cluster, which has three central giant elliptical galaxies acting as an efficient \"grinding machine\". Our cluster has a bi-modal radial-velocity distribution and thus two possible values for the velocity dispersion. We find that the cluster fits well in the correlation between BCG+ICL fraction and cluster mass for a range of velocity dispersions, leading us to question the validity of a relevant correlation between these two quantities.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1426708851,0,0),(962607,668722,'1101.5033','2011-01-28 12\:58\:15','2011-01-31 01\:01\:23',46782,'Luis Granda','ngranda@univalle.edu.co',7447,'pdftex','1','Holographic unification of dark matter and dark energy','L.

The size of the sample does not depend on the size (number of tuples) of the database, but is a function of the complexity of the queries we plan to run, measured by their VC-dimension. The major theoretical contribution of this work is an explicit bound on the VC-dimension of a range space defined by all possible outcomes of a collection of queries. We prove that the VC-dimension is a function of the maximum number of Boolean operations in the selection predicate, and of the maximum number of select and join operations in any individual query in the collection, but it is not a function of the number of queries in the collection. The sample representation computed by our method is typically sufficiently small to be stored in main memory. Once a sample representation is precomputed, it can be used to evaluate the selectivity of multiple queries belonging to the collection. The sample needs to be refreshed only following major changes in the database. We present experimental results validating our theoretical analysis and demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of our technique.

We present the results of a SN survey to ~27 mag in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF). Over a period of 3 years, we have observed the SDF on 4 independent epochs with Suprime-Cam on the Subaru 8.2-m telescope, with 2 nights of exposure per epoch, in the R, i'', and z'' bands. We have discovered 150 SNe out to redshift z~2. Using 11 photometric bands from the observer-frame far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, we derive photometric redshifts for the SN host galaxies (for 24 we also have spectroscopic redshifts). This information is combined with the SN photometry to determine the type and redshift distribution of the SN sample. Our final sample includes 26 SNe Ia in the range 1.0<z<1.5 and 10 in the range 1.5<z<2.0. Our SN Ia rate measurements are consistent with those derived from the HST/GOODS sample, but they have statistical uncertainties that are 2-3 times smaller. We find that the SN Ia rate evolution levels off at 1.0<z<2.0, but shows no sign of declining. Combining our SN Ia rate measurements and those from the literature, and comparing to a wide range of possible SFHs, the best-fitting DTD is a power law of the form Psi(t) ~ t^beta, with beta = -0.97 +/- 0.26 (statistical) +/- 0.17 (systematic). This result is consistent with other recent DTD measurements at various redshifts and environments, and is in agreement with a generic prediction of the double-degenerate progenitor scenario for SNe Ia. By combining the contribution to iron production from core-collapse SNe, based on the wide range of SFHs, with that from SNe Ia, calculated with the best-fitting DTD, we predict that the mean present-day cosmic iron abundance is in the range Z(Fe) = (0.06-0.37) Z(Fe,Sun) (abridged).','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1296608406,0,0),(963470,669777,'1102.0007','2011-01-31 21\:00\:37','2011-02-03 01\:00\:41',6200,'Avi Loeb','aloeb@cfa.harvard.edu',56256,'tex','','On the Importance of Hypervelocity Stars for the Long-Term Future of Cosmology','Abraham Loeb (Harvard)','astro-ph.CO gr-qc hep-ph','4 pages, 2 figures',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'In the standard cosmological model, the merger remnant of the Milky Way and Andromeda (Milkomeda) will be the only galaxy remaining within our event horizon once the Universe has aged by another factor of ten, ~10^{11} years after the Big Bang.

We study viable dark matter candidates in WIMPless AMSB models with non-Abelian hidden sectors and highlight unusual possibilities that emerge in even the simplest models. In one example with a pure SU(N) hidden sector, stable hidden gluinos freeze out with the correct relic density, but have an extremely low, but natural, confinement scale, providing a framework for self-interacting dark matter. In another simple scenario, hidden gluinos freeze out and decay to visible Winos with the correct relic density, and hidden glueballs may either be stable, providing a natural framework for mixed cold-hot dark matter, or may decay, yielding astrophysical signals. Last, we present a model with light hidden pions that may be tested with improved constraints on the number of non-relativistic degrees of freedom. All of these scenarios are defined by a small number of parameters, are consistent with gauge coupling unification, preserve the beautiful connection between the weak scale and the observed dark matter relic density, and are natural, with relatively light visible superpartners.

We integrate the geodesic deviation equation in tandem with the N-body equations of motion, demonstrating that this can produce numerically converged results for the properties of fine-grained phase-space streams and their associated caustics, even in the inner regions of haloes. Our effective resolution for such structures is many orders of magnitude better than achieved by conventional techniques on even the largest simulations. We apply these methods to the six Milky Way-mass haloes of the Aquarius Project. At 8 kpc from halo centre a typical point intersects about 10^14 streams with a very broad range of individual densities; the ~10^6 most massive streams contribute about half of the local dark matter density. As a result, the velocity distribution of dark matter particles should be very smooth with the most massive fine-grained stream contributing about 0.1% of the total signal. Dark matter particles at this radius have typically passed 200 caustics since the Big Bang. The peak densities on present-day caustics in the inner halo almost all lie well below the mean local dark matter density. As a result caustics provide a negligible boost (<0.1%) to the predicted local dark matter annihilation rate. The effective boost is larger in the outer halo but never exceeds about 10%. Thus fine-grained streams and their associated caustics have no effect on the detectability of dark matter, either directly in Earth-bound laboratories, or indirectly through annihilation radiation, with the exception that resonant cavity experiments searching for axions may see the most massive local fine-grained streams because of their extreme localisation in energy/momentum space.

We also analyze new and archival NB4980 imaging tuned to the wavelength of the Lya emission line at z=3.09, and archival broadband B, V, and R images of the non-ionizing UV continuum. Our NB3640 images contain 26 z>3.06 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) as well as a set of 130 Lya emitters (LAEs), identified by their excess NB4980 flux relative to the BV continuum. Six LBGs and 28 LAEs are detected in the NB3640 image. LBGs appear to span a range of NB3640-R colors, while LAEs appear bimodal in their NB3640-R properties. We estimate average UV to LyC flux density ratios, corrected for foreground contamination and intergalactic medium absorption, finding <F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LBG} = 11.3^{+10.3}_{-5.4}, which implies a LBG LyC escape fraction f_{esc}^{LyC} ~ 0.1, and <F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LAE} = 2.2^{+0.9}_{-0.6}. The strikingly blue LAE flux density ratios defy interpretation in terms of standard stellar population models.

We identified 142 dense clumps within our sample and found that our sources are divided into two categories\: those with clumps that show a power law size-line width relation (Type I) and those which do not show any relation (Type II). The clumps in the Type I sources have larger power law indices than found in previous studies. The clumps in the Type II sources have larger line widths and show evidence (such as outflows) of current active star formation within the clump. We suggest that the lack of a size-line width relation is a sign of current active star formation. Massive clumps seem to have similar masses calculated by different methods but lower mass clumps have larger virial masses compared to velocity integrated and LTE mass. We found no relation between mass distribution of the clumps and distance from the H~II region ionization front, but a weak decrease of the excitation temperature with increasing distance from the ionized gas. The clumps in collected shells around the H~II regions have slightly larger line widths but no relation was found between line width and distance from the H~II region, which probably indicates that the internal dynamics of the clumps are not affected by the ionized gas. Internal sources of turbulence, such as outflows and stellar winds from young proto-stars may have a more important role on the molecular gas dynamics. We suggest that large line width and larger size-line width power law indices are therefore the initial characteristics of clumps in massive star forming clouds and that some may evolve into objects similar to our Type II sources, where local \"second generation\" stars are forming and eliminating the size-line-width relation.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1432738907,1,0),(963925,670058,'1102.0288','2011-02-01 21\:00\:10','2015-03-18 20\:18\:39',166556,'Chan Y.

An improved BayeSN MCMC code computes probabilistic inferences for the hierarchical model by sampling the global probability density of parameters describing individual supernovae and the population. We have applied this hierarchical model to optical and NIR data of 127 SN Ia from PAIRITEL, CfA3, CSP, and the literature. We find an apparent population correlation between the host galaxy extinction A_V and the the ratio of total-to-selective dust absorption R_V. For SN with low dust extinction, A_V < 0.4, we find R_V = 2.5 - 2.9, while at high extinctions, A_V > 1, low values of R_V < 2 are favored. The NIR luminosities are excellent standard candles and are less sensitive to dust extinction. They exhibit low correlation with optical peak luminosities, and thus provide independent information on distances. The combination of NIR and optical data constrains the dust extinction and improves the predictive precision of individual SN Ia distances by about 60%. Using cross-validation, we estimate an rms distance modulus prediction error of 0.11 mag for SN with optical and NIR data versus 0.15 mag for SN with optical data alone. Continued study of SN Ia in the NIR is important for improving their utility as precise and accurate cosmological distance indicators.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1426602465,0,0),(963929,670061,'1102.0291','2011-02-01 21\:01\:30','2015-05-27 15\:01\:48',58277,'Daniel Fabrycky','daniel.fabrycky@gmail.com',1774873,'pdf','1','A Closely-Packed System of Low-Mass, Low-Density Planets Transiting Kepler-11','Jack J.

Here, a new method for creating band-limited images from undersampled data is presented. The method uses a drizzled image as a first order approximation and then rapidly converges toward a band-limited image which fits the data given the statistical weighting provided by the drizzled image. The method, named iDrizzle, for iterative Drizzle, effectively eliminates both the small high-frequency artifacts and convolution with an interpolant kernel that can be introduced by drizzling. The method works well in the presence of geometric distortion, and can easily handle cosmic rays, bad pixels, or other missing data. It can combine images taken with random dithers, though the number of dithers required to obtain a good final image depends in part on the quality of the dither placements. iDrizzle may prove most beneficial for producing high-fidelity point spread functions from undersampled images, and could be particularly valuable for future Dark Energy missions such as WFIRST and EUCLID, which will likely attempt to do high precision supernova photometry and lensing experiments with undersampled detectors.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1296694812,0,0),(963931,670063,'1102.0293','2011-02-01 21\:09\:29','2015-03-18 20\:18\:43',67532,'Krzysztof Rolbiecki','krolb@fuw.edu.pl',139623,'tex','','Early spin determination at the LHC?','Gudrid Moortgat-Pick, Krzysztof Rolbiecki and Jamie Tattersall','hep-ph','6 pages, 5 figures',NULL,'DESY 11-017, Bonn-TH-2011-03',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'If signals of new physics are discovered at the LHC it will be crucial to determine the spin structure of a new model.

Given that the modulation of the supergranular scale imprints itself in variations of the Sun''s spectral irradiance, as well as in the mass and energy transport into the entire outer atmosphere, this preliminary investigation is an important step in understanding the impact of the quiet sun on the heliospheric system.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1296694817,0,0),(963944,670074,'1102.0304','2011-02-01 21\:40\:27','2011-02-03 01\:00\:18',15751,'Alan L.

These frequency \"combs\" are produced primarily using relatively large, ultrafast laser systems. However, recent research has shown that broad-bandwidth combs can be produced using highly-nonlinear interactions in microresonator optical parametric oscillators [4-11]. Such devices not only offer the potential for developing extremely compact optical atomic clocks but are also promising for astronomical spectroscopy [12-14], ultrashort pulse shaping [15], and ultrahigh-speed communications systems. Here we demonstrate the generation of broad-bandwidth optical frequency combs from a CMOS-compatible integrated microresonator [16,17], which is a fully-monolithic and sealed chip-scale device making it insensitive to the surrounding environment. We characterize the comb quality using a novel self-referencing method and verify that the comb line frequencies are equidistant over a bandwidth that is nearly an order of magnitude larger than previous measurements.

The results for the $\\pm J$ model and the Gaussian model are respectively shown.\n  In the present article, it is respectively shown for the $\\pm J$ model and the Gaussian model that, by adjusting an introduced parameter for Niedermayer''s algorithm, the percolation threshold obtained in the present article agrees with the location of the multicritical point. We naively estimate the locations of the multicritical points for the $\\pm J$ model and the Gaussian model on the randam graphs with arbitary degree distributions.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',5,1296694832,1,1),(963987,610983,'1004.0773','2011-02-02 00\:55\:56','2015-03-13 21\:07\:58',43463,'Roberto A.

These configurations provide a simple but useful generalization of the Lambda-CDM model describing cold dark matter (CDM) and a Lambda term, which seems to fit current cosmological observations. The dynamics of these models can be fully described by scalar evolution equations that can be given in the form of a proper dynamical system associated with a 4-dimensional phase space whose critical points and invariant subspaces are examined and classified. The phase space evolution of various configurations is studied in detail by means of two 2-dimensional subspaces\: a projection into the invariant homogeneous subspace associated with Lambda-CDM solutions with FLRW metric, and a projection into a subspace generated by suitably defined fluctuations that convey the effects of inhomogeneity. We look at cases with perpetual expansion, bouncing and loitering behavior, as well as configurations with \"mixed\" kinematic patters, such as a collapsing region in an expanding background. In all cases, phase space trajectories emerge from and converge to stable past and future attractors in a qualitatively analogous way as in the case of the FLRW limit. However, we can identify in both projections of the phase space various qualitative features absent in the FLRW limit that can be useful in the construction of toy models of astrophysical and cosmological inhomogeneities.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1426280878,1,0),(963988,667508,'1101.3819','2011-02-02 01\:01\:18','2015-05-27 14\:55\:50',120700,'Han Hsu','hsuhan@umn.edu',714819,'tex','','Spin-state crossover and hyperfine interactions of ferric iron in MgSiO$_3$ perovskite','Han Hsu, Peter Blaha, Matteo Cococcioni, and Renata M.

FeTe exhibits a sign reversal from positive to negative across the transition to the low-temperature antiferromagnetic state, indicating the occurrence of drastic reconstruction in the band structure. The mobility analysis using the carrier density theoretically calculated reveals that the mobility of holes is strongly suppressed to zero, and hence the electric transport looks to be dominated by electrons. The Se substitution to Te suppresses the antiferromagnetic long-range order and induces superconductivity instead. The similar mobility analysis for Fe(Se0.4Te0.6) and Fe(Se0.5Te0.5) thin films shows that the mobility of electrons increases with decreasing temperature even in the paramagnetic state, and keeps sufficiently high values down to the superconducting transition temperature.

Through this parameter $q$, we can control the epoch at which the scalar field starts growing.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1426709974,1,0),(964008,670112,'1102.0342','2011-02-02 02\:10\:58','2011-02-03 01\:00\:39',123600,'Timothy Brown','tbrown@lcogt.net',555009,'tex','','Kepler Input Catalog\: Photometric Calibration and Stellar Classification','Timothy M.

The KIC is a catalog containing photometric and physical data for sources in the Kepler Mission field of view; it is used by the mission to select optimal targets. We derived atmospheric extinction corrections from hourly observations of secondary standard fields within the Kepler field of view. Repeatability of absolute photometry for stars brighter than magnitude 15 is typically 2%. We estimated stellar parameters Teff, log(g), log (Z), E_{B-V} using Bayesian posterior probability maximization to match observed colors to Castelli stellar atmosphere models. We applied Bayesian priors describing the distribution of solar-neighborhood stars in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), in log (Z)$, and in height above the galactic plane. Comparisons with samples of stars classified by other means indicate that in most regions of the CMD, our classifications are reliable within about +/- 200 K and +/- 0.4 dex in log (g). It is difficult to assess the reliability of our log(Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it is poor, particularly at extreme Teff. Of great importance for the Kepler Mission, for Teff <= 5400 K, the distinction between main-sequence stars and giants has proved to be reliable with better than 98% confidence.

Because of the potential importance of understanding the origin of the ICL in the context of the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe, the field has recently undergone a revival both in the quality and quantity of observational and theoretical investigations. Due to cosmological dimming, the observational work has mostly concentrated on low redshift clusters, but clearly observations at higher redshifts can provide interesting clues about the evolution of the diffuse component. In this paper we present the first results of a program to characterize the ICL of intermediate redshift clusters. We find that at z ~ 0.3, the X-ray cluster RX J0054.0-2823 already has a significant ICL and that the fraction of the total light in the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is comparable to that of similar clusters at lower redshift. We also find that the kinematics of the ICL is consistent with it being the remnant of tidally destroyed galaxies streaming in the central regions of the cluster, which has three central giant elliptical galaxies acting as an efficient \"grinding machine\". Our cluster has a bi-modal radial-velocity distribution and thus two possible values for the velocity dispersion. We find that the cluster fits well in the correlation between BCG+ICL fraction and cluster mass for a range of velocity dispersions, leading us to question the validity of a relevant correlation between these two quantities.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1432738752,1,0),(964018,670120,'1102.0350','2011-02-02 03\:07\:25','2011-02-03 01\:00\:44',61820,'Tarun Grover','grover@berkeley.edu',1830634,'tex','','Entanglement entropy of critical spin liquids','Yi Zhang, Tarun Grover and Ashvin Vishwanath','cond-mat.str-el','6+ pages, 6 figures',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'We use bipartite entanglement entropy, in particular the Renyi entropy $S_{2}$ to investigate the quantum structure of candidate ground states of critical spin-liquids.

We show the properties of the jammed packings are independent of the distribution of defects within the system and that all the packings are isostatic. This suggests the assumption of equal probability for states of equal volume, which provides one possible way of constructing the equivalent of a microcanonical ensemble, is likely to be vaild for our model. An application of the second law of thermodynamics involving two subsystems in contact shows that the expected spontaneous equilibration of defects between the two is accompanied by an increase in entropy and that the equilibirum, obtained by entropy maximization, is characterized by the equality of compactivities.

In the framework the original inverse problem is reduced to an inverse problem whose governing equation has a large parameter. A list of requirements which enables one to apply the enclosure method to the reduced inverse problem is given.\n  Two new results which can be considered as the application of the framework are given. In the first result the background conductive body is assumed to be homogeneous and a family of explicit complex exponential solutions are employed. Second an application of the framework to inclusions in an isotropic inhomogeneous heat conductive body is given. The main problem is the construction of the special solution of the governing equation with a large parameter for the background inhomogeneous body required by the framework.

We consider these cosmologies in the framework of nonrelativistic supersymmetry that has been effective in the area of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Recalling that Faraoni [Amer. J. Phys. 67 (1999), 732-734] showed how to reduce the barotropic FRW system of differential equations to simple harmonic oscillator differential equations, we set the latter equations in the supersymmetric approach and divide their solutions into two classes of ''bosonic'' (nonsingular) and ''fermionic'' (singular) cosmological zero-mode solutions. The fermionic equations can be considered as representing cosmologies of Stephani type, i.e., inhomogeneous and curvature-changing in the conformal time. We next apply the so-called shifted Riccati procedure by introducing a constant additive parameter, denoted by S, in the common Riccati solution of these supersymmetric partner cosmologies. This leads to barotropic Stephani cosmologies with periodic singularities in their spatial curvature indices that we call U and V cosmologies, the first being of bosonic type and the latter of fermionic type. We solve completely these cyclic singular cosmologies at the level of their zero modes showing that an acceptable shift parameter should be purely imaginary, which in turn introduces a parity-time (PT) property of the partner curvature indices.','http\://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/',2,1426604387,1,0),(964041,654690,'1011.3722','2011-02-02 05\:54\:37','2011-02-08 01\:00\:43',48052,'Koujin Takeda','takeda@sp.dis.titech.ac.jp',185406,'tex','','Statistical mechanical analysis of a hierarchical random code ensemble in signal processing','Tomoyuki Obuchi, Kazutaka Takahashi, Koujin Takeda','cond-mat.dis-nn cs.IT math.IT','24 pages, 4 figures',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'J.

Novel decentralized estimation schemes are suggested, according to which the sensors communicate at two-sided exit times of appropriate sufficient statistics. For independent, as well as certain correlated, diffusion-type processes it is shown that the proposed estimators are asymptotically optimal; that is, for sufficiently large horizons, they behave as the corresponding optimal estimators that have full access to the sensor observations. This property holds even with an asymptotically low rate of communication and an asymptotically large number of sensors, a very desirable characteristic from a practical point of view. The case of discrete sampling is also considered in the Brownian case; it is shown that the proposed decentralized estimator remains asymptotically optimal under a sufficiently high sampling rate, which is specified as a function of the corresponding communication rate.

The range of applications includes communication-systems to DNA-sequencing. If there is interference present on a transmitted signal, it could be due to a natural cause or superimposed forcefully. In the latter case, its early detection and analysis becomes important. In such situations having a small observation window, a quick look at power-spectrum can reveal a great deal of information, including frequency and source of interference. In this paper, we present our design of a FPGA based reconfigurable platform for high performance power-spectrum analysis.

Recent surveys, like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Anglo-Australian Two-degree survey (2dF), have shown that there seems to be a correlation between the clustering of galaxies and their properties such as metallicity and star formation rate, which are believed to be environment-dependent. This environmental dependence is not included in the standard halo model where the host halo mass is the only variable specifying galaxy properties. In our approach, the halo properties i.e., the concentration, and the Halo Occupation Distribution --HOD-- prescription, will not only depend on the halo mass (like in the standard halo model) but also on the halo environment. We examine how different environmental dependence of halo concentration and HOD prescription affect the correlation function. We see that at the level of dark matter, the concentration of haloes affects moderately the dark matter correlation function only at small scales. However the galaxy correlation function is extremely sensitive to the HOD details, even when only the HOD of a small fraction of haloes is modified.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1432044889,1,0),(964064,658856,'1012.1212','2011-02-02 08\:37\:11','2015-03-17 14\:49\:52',164548,'Stefan Roth','stefan.roth@physik.tu-darmstadt.de',158109,'tex','','Topological defect formation from 2PI effective action techniques','J.

The variations of the quantum discord as a function of anisotropy parameter, magnetic field and temperature are investigated. We obtain a number of interesting results such as a finite value of the quantum discord in the trimer ground state for which the pairwise entanglement is known to be zero, differences in the nature of some of the variations in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases and discontinuous jumps in the magnitude of the quantum discord at first order quantum phase transition points.

One can also construct validity domains based on polynomial fits to the frequencies from the two-dimensional approach, and these also turn out to be similar, thus further confirming the agreement between the perturbative and two-dimensional approach at low rotation rates. Furthermore, as was previously shown in Espinosa, Perez Hernandez and Roca Cortes (2004), adjacent frequencies in multiplets come close together, thus forming pairs. This phenomena, exclusive to two-dimensional calculations, is shown to be an unlikely explanation of the close frequency pairs observed in delta Scuti stars. A systematic search for all close frequency pairs in the calculated spectrum is also carried out. The number of close frequency pairs is shown to agree with what is expected based on a Poisson distribution, but does not match the number or distribution of close pairs in stars like FG Vir.

Early ideas that this would lead to an easy and straightforward way of measuring the mass-loss rates were thwarted by the presence of clumping in the stellar wind. Multi-wavelength observations provide important constraints on this clumping, but do not allow its full determination. Non-thermal radio emission is associated with binarity. This conclusion was already known for some time for Wolf-Rayet stars and in recent years it has become clear that it is also true for O-type stars. In a massive-star binary, the two stellar winds collide and around the shocks a fraction of the electrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds. Spiralling in the magnetic field these electrons emit synchrotron radiation, which we detect as non-thermal radio emission.

Here we discuss the possible role of hydrogen collected from the solar wind by the early Earth magnetosphere. While the water production by solar wind capture is very small today it may have been significant during the first billion years after planetary formation because solar wind was much stronger at that time and Earth magnetospheric configuration may have been different. We estimate that the contribution of solar wind hydrogen to the Earth water reserves can be up to 10% when we assume a that the Earth dipole acted as a collector and early solar wind was 1000 times stronger than today.

The general concept of a locally resonant sonic crystal is proposed, which utilises acoustic resonances to form additional band gaps that are decoupled from Bragg gaps. An existence of a separate attenuation mechanism associated with the resonant elements, which increases performance in the lower frequency regime has been identified. The results show a formation of broad band gaps positioned significantly below the first Bragg frequency. For low frequency broadband attenuation a most optimal configuration is the Matryoshka sonic crystal, where each scattering unit is composed of multiple concentric slotted cylinders. This system forms numerous gaps in the lower frequency regime, below Bragg bands, whilst maintaining a reduced crystal size viable for noise barrier technology.

The non-Gaussian mass function has been calculated by several authors in different ways, typically by exploiting the smallness of certain parameters which naturally appear in the calculation, to set up a perturbative expansion. We improve upon the existing results for the mass function by combining path integral methods and saddle point techniques (which have been separately applied in previous approaches). Additionally, we carefully account for the various scale dependent combinations of small parameters which appear. Some of these combinations in fact become of order unity for large mass scales and at high redshifts, and must therefore be treated non-perturbatively. Our approach allows us to do this, and to also account for multi-scale density correlations which appear in the calculation. We thus derive an accurate expression for the mass function which is based on approximations that are valid over a larger range of mass scales and redshifts than those of other authors. By tracking the terms ignored in the analysis, we estimate theoretical errors for our result and also for the results of others. We also discuss the complications introduced by the choice of smoothing filter function, which we take to be a top-hat in real space, and which leads to the dominant errors in our expression. Finally, we present a detailed comparison between the various expressions for the mass functions, exploring the accuracy and range of validity of each.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1426542936,1,0),(964100,670171,'1102.0401','2011-02-02 10\:58\:35','2011-02-03 01\:01\:12',11939,'Vadim E.

One of our most significant findings is evidence for a flattening in the radial GC number density profile in the outer halo. Intriguingly, this occurs at a galactocentric radius of ~2 degrees (~30 kpc) which is the radius at which the underlying stellar halo surface density has also been shown to flatten. The GCs which lie beyond this radius are remarkably uniform in terms of their blue (V-I)o colours, consistent with them belonging to an ancient population with little to no metallicity gradient. Structural parameters are also derived for a sample of 13 newly-discovered extended clusters (ECs) and we find the lowest luminosity ECs have magnitudes and sizes similar to Palomar-type GCs in the Milky Way halo.

The sample is composed of normal ETGs having effective radii comparable to the mean radius of local ones and of compact ETGs having effective radii from two to six times smaller. We do not find evidence of a dependence of the compactness of ETGs on their stellar mass. We find that the stellar mass of normal ETGs formed at z_form<3 while the stellar content of compact ETGs formed at 2<z_form<10 with a large fraction of them characterized by z_form>5. Earlier stars formed at z_form>5 are assembled in compact and more massive (M_*>10^11 M_sun) ETGs while stars later formed (z_form<3) or resulting from subsequent episodes of star formation are assembled both in compact and normal ETGs. Thus, the older the stellar population the higher the mass of the hosting galaxy but not vice versa. This suggests that the epoch of formation may play a role in the formation of massive ETGs rather than the mass itself. The possible general scheme in which normal <z>~1.5 ETGs are descendants of high-z compact spheroids enlarged through subsequent dry mergers is not compatible with the current models which predict a number of dry mergers two orders of magnitude lower than the one needed. Moreover, we do not find evidence supporting a dependence of the compactness of galaxies on their redshift of assembly. Finally, we propose a simple scheme of formation and assembly of the stellar mass of ETGs based on dissipative gas-rich merger which can qualitatively account for the co-existence of normal and compact ETGs observed at <z>~1.5 in spite of the same stellar mass, the lack of normal ETGs with high z_form and the absence of correlation between compactness, stellar mass and formation redshift.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1432109878,1,0),(964112,670177,'1102.0407','2011-02-02 11\:50\:54','2011-03-23 00\:02\:36',25200,'Chiu Fan Lee','cflee@pks.mpg.de',20282,'tex','','Singular perturbation analysis of a reduced model for collective motion\: A renormalization group approach','Chiu Fan Lee','cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Physical Review E 83, 031127 (2011)','10.1103/PhysRevE.83.031127','In a system of noisy self-propelled particles with interactions that favor directional alignment, collective motion will appear if the density of particles is beyond a critical density.

Additionally, we compare kinematic results obtained with two imaging methods based on different deconvolution algorithms. The blazar 0716+714 has a diffuse large-scale jet and a very faint bright compact core. Experiments with simulated data showed that the conventional data reduction procedure based on the CLEAN deconvolution algorithm does not perform well in restoring this type of structure. This might be the reason why previous kinematic studies of this source yielded ambiguous results. In order to obtain accurate kinematics of this source, we independently applied two imaging techniques to the raw data\: the conventional method, based on difference mapping, which uses CLEAN deconvolution, and the generalized maximum entropy method (GMEM) realized in the VLBImager package developed at the Pulkovo Observatory in Russia. The results of both methods give us a consistent kinematic scenario\: the large-scale jet of 0716+714 is diffuse and stationary. Differences between the inner (0-1 mas) and outer (1-12 mas) regions of the jet in brightness and velocity of the components could be explained by the bending of the jet, which causes the angle between the jet direction and the line of sight to change from ~5 deg to ~11 deg.

One of the most intriguing aspects is the boost towards the development of highly accurate models able to recon- struct the light path consistently with General Relativity and the precepts of measurements.

In this model thermal equilibrium is reached at all finite temperatures and therefore we can consider jumps from low to high temperatures in addition to the quenches usually considered in aging studies. We show that the evolution of the energy following the Kovacs-protocol can approximately be expressed as a difference of two monotonously decaying functions and thus show the existence of a so-called Kovacs hump whenever these functions are not single exponentials. It is well established that the Kovacs effect also occurs in the linear response regime and we show that most of the gross features do not change dramatically when large temperature jumps are considered. However, there is one distinguishing feature that only exists beyond the linear regime which we discuss in detail. For the memory experiment with ''inverted'' temperatures, i.e. jumping up and then down again, we find a very similar behavior apart from an opposite sign of the hump.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1432738924,1,0),(964121,670182,'1102.0412','2011-02-02 12\:12\:39','2011-03-11 01\:00\:33',64795,'Alan Aversa','aversa@u.arizona.edu',697958,'tex','','VLA and ATCA Search for Natal Star Clusters in Nearby Star-Forming Galaxies','Alan Aversa, Kelsey Johnson, Crystal Brogan, W.

Natal star-forming regions can be identified by their characteristic thermal radio emission, which is manifest in their spectral index at centimeter wavelengths. The host galaxies in our sample were selected based upon their likelihood of harboring young star formation. In star-forming regions, the ionizing flux of massive embedded stars powers the dominant thermal free-free emission of those sources, resulting in a spectral index of {\\alpha} {\\gtrsim} -0.2 (where S{\\nu} {\\propto} {\\nu}{\\alpha}), which we compute. With the current sensitivity, we find that of the 25 galaxies in this sample only five have radio sources with spectral indices that are only consistent with a thermal origin; four have radio sources that are only consistent with a non-thermal origin; six have radio sources whose nature is ambiguous due to uncertainties in the spectral index; and sixteen have no detected radio sources. For those sources that appear to be dominated by thermal emission, we infer the ionizing flux of the star clusters and the number of equivalent O7.5 V stars that are required to produce the observed radio flux densities. The most radio-luminous clusters that we detect have an equivalent of ~7x103 O7.5 V stars, and the smallest only have an equivalent of ~102 O7.5 V stars; thus these star-forming regions span the range of large OB-associations to moderate \"super star clusters\" (SSCs).

Rather, new search algorithms are required that take account of the intrinsic 3-body motion of the source as well as the motion of the Earth.

On the other hand, near the phase transition the 1/Nc expansion breaks down and a non-perturbative scheme for the inclusion of mesonic correlations is needed in order to describe the phase transition region.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1426603087,0,0),(964141,670192,'1102.0422','2011-02-02 13\:11\:15','2011-02-03 01\:01\:29',50145,'Jan Grabowski','jan.grabowski@maths.ox.ac.uk',22586,'tex','','A quantum analogue of the dihedral action on Grassmannians','Justin M.

We explicitly show that for points outside the monopole''s core the scalar self-energy presents two distinct contributions. The first one is induced by the non-trivial topology of the global monopole considered as a point-like defect and the second is a correction induced by the non-vanishing inner structure attributed to it.

These terms arise because the relativistic translational velocity induces a quiver motion in the direction of the magnetic force, which is the direction of large field gradients. Oscillation of the Lorentz factor effectively doubles this magnetic contribution.

Thus, we established two different experimental methods to produce micrometer-sized water ice particles, i. e. by spraying water droplets into liquid nitrogen an by spraying water droplets into a cold nitrogen atmosphere. We found that the size of the ice particles, produced with the different methods, are very similar (arithmetic means of the particle radii for the two different methods\: (1.49+-0.79) micrometer and (1.45+-0.65) micrometer, respectively). Ice aggregates composed of the micrometer-sized ice particles are highly porous (volume filling factor\: 0.11+-0.01) or rather compact (volume filling factor\: 0.72+-0.04), depending on the method of production. Furthermore, a rolling friction force of (114.8+-23.8)*10^(-10) N was measured for micrometer-sized ice particles, which exceeds the rolling friction force of micrometer-sized SiO2 particles ((12.1+-3.6)*10^(-10) N). This result implies that the adhesive bonding between micrometer-sized ice particles is stronger than the bonding strength between SiO2 particles. An estimation of the specific surface energy of micrometer-sized ice particles, derived from the measured rolling friction forces and the surface energy of micrometer-sized SiO2 particles, results in a specific surface energy of the ice particles ranging between 0.100 J m^(-2) and 0.185 J m^(-2).','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1296694893,0,0),(964153,662725,'1012.5081','2011-02-02 14\:03\:20','2011-02-03 01\:01\:34',163780,'Jay Armas','jay@nbi.dk',57883,'tex','','Blackfolds in (Anti)-de Sitter Backgrounds','Jay Armas, Niels A.

We directly obtain the emissivity profile of the disc from the observed spectrum by considering the reflection component as the sum of contributions from successive radii in the disc and fitting to find the relative weightings of these components in a relativistically-broadened emission line. This method has successfully recovered known emissivity profiles from synthetic spectra and is applied to XMM-Newton spectra of the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0707-495. The data imply a twice-broken power law form of the emissivity law with a steep profile in the inner regions of the disc (index 7.8) and then a flat region between 5.6rg and 34.8rg before tending to a constant index of 3.3 over the outer regions of the disc.

We investigate the Caltech-Jodrell Bank flat-spectrum (CJF) sample to study the connection between AGN jet kinematics and their gamma-ray properties. The high number of sources included in the sample, in addition to the excellent kinematic data available, allows us to investigate the origin of gamma-ray emission in AGN. We identify the CJF sources detected in gamma-rays (by Fermi-LAT and EGRET). We use gamma-ray luminosities and the available VLBI kinematic data to look for correlations between gamma-ray and kinematic properties, as well as for differences between AGN classes (quasars, BL Lacs, radio galaxies). We also check the kinematics of the TeV sources in the CJF. 21.8% of the CJF has been detected in the gamma-rays. We find the detectability of BL Lacs significantly higher compared to quasars. gamma-detected sources show a wider apparent jet velocity distribution compared to the non-detected ones, but the maxima of both distributions are at similar values. No strong link between gamma-ray detectability and fast apparent jet speeds is found. A tentative correlation is found between gamma-ray luminosity and maximum apparent jet speeds, stronger for BL Lac and gamma-variable sources. We find non-radial jet motions to be important to gamma-ray emission. We suggest two-zone, spine-sheath, models as a possible explanation to our results.

The normal-state phase diagram as a function of interaction strength $U$, temperature $T$, and filling $n$ shows that, upon increasing $n$ towards the Mott insulator, there is a surface of first-order transition between two metals at nonzero doping. That surface ends at a finite temperature critical line originating at the half-filled Mott critical point.

AIMS. In this contribution we highlight the importance to account for the orbital eccentricity and longitude of periastron of the planetary orbit to accurately interpret the measured planetary radial velocity during the transit. Methods\: We calculate the radial velocity of a transiting planet in an eccentric orbit. Given the larger orbital speed of planets with respect to their stellar companions even small eccentricities can result in detectable blue or redshift radial velocity offsets during the transit with respect to the systemic velocity, the exact value depending also on the longitude of the periastron of the planetary orbit. For an hot-jupiter planet, an eccentricity of only e=0.01 can produce a radial velocity offset of the order of the km/s. Conclusions\: We propose an alternative interpretation of the recently claimed radial velocity blueshift (~2 km/s) of the planetary spectral lines of HD209458b which implies that the orbit of this system is not exactly circular. In this case, the longitude of the periastron of the stellar orbit is most likely confined in the first quadrant (and that one of the planet in the third quadrant). We highlight that transmission spectroscopy allows not only to study the compositional properties of planetary atmospheres, but also to refine their orbital parameters and that any conclusion regarding the presence of windflows on planetary surfaces coming from transmission spectroscopy measurements requires precise known orbital parameters from RV.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1432738926,1,0),(964202,670235,'1102.0465','2011-02-02 15\:36\:25','2011-02-03 01\:01\:54',149763,'Giulia Macario','g.macario@ira.inaf.it',985065,'tex','','GMRT 150 MHz follow up of diffuse steep spectrum radio emission in galaxy clusters','G.

We assume that the agents are identical, and move in synchronous rounds.\n  We first show that if the delay between the starting times of the agents is arbitrary, then the lower bound on memory required for rendezvous is Omega(log n) bits, even for the line of length n. This lower bound meets a previously known upper bound of O(log n) bits for rendezvous in arbitrary graphs of size at most n. Our main result is a proof that the amount of memory needed for rendezvous with simultaneous start depends essentially on the number L of leaves of the tree, and is exponentially less impacted by the number n of nodes. Indeed, we present two identical agents with O(log L + loglog n) bits of memory that solve the rendezvous problem in all trees with at most n nodes and at most L leaves. Hence, for the class of trees with polylogarithmically many leaves, there is an exponential gap in minimum memory size needed for rendezvous between the scenario with arbitrary delay and the scenario with delay zero. Moreover, we show that our upper bound is optimal by proving that Omega(log L + loglog n)$ bits of memory are required for rendezvous, even in the class of trees with degrees bounded by 3.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1426710112,1,0),(964206,663495,'1012.5851','2011-02-02 15\:44\:46','2015-03-17 15\:12\:33',5093,'H.

With present photon data from the observations of distant astrophysical sources, it is possible to constrain the Lorentz Symmetry breaking linear term in the standard photon dispersion relations. Gamma-ray Bursts (GRB) and flaring Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are complementary to each other for this purpose, since they are observed at different distances in different energy ranges and with different levels of variability. Following a previous publication of the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) collaboration, a more sensitive event-by-event method consisting of a likelihood fit is applied to PKS 2155-304 flare data of MJD 53944 (July 28, 2006) as used in the previous publication. The previous limit on the linear term is improved by a factor of ~3 up to M^{l}_{QG} > 2.1x10^{18} GeV and is currently the best result obtained with blazars. The sensitivity to the quadratic term is lower and provides a limit of M^{q}_{QG} > 6.4x10^10 GeV, which is the best value obtained so far with an AGN and similar to the best limits obtained with GRB.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1304000397,1,0),(964209,670238,'1102.0468','2011-02-01 01\:15\:16','2011-02-03 01\:01\:59',48626,'Ward Struyve','Ward.Struyve@fys.kuleuven.be',22276,'tex','1','Gauge invariant accounts of the Higgs mechanism','Ward Struyve','physics.gen-ph math-ph math.MP','23 pages, no figures, LaTex',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'The Higgs mechanism gives mass to Yang-Mills gauge bosons.

In this paper, we present a general discussion of such gauge invariant treatments for the case of the Abelian Higgs model, in the context of classical field theory.

The execution of a query on the sample provides an accurate estimate for the selectivity (or cardinality of the output) of each operation in the execution of the query on the original large database. The size of the sample does not depend on the size (number of tuples) of the database, but is a function of the complexity of the queries we plan to run, measured by their VC-dimension. The major theoretical contribution of this work is an explicit bound on the VC-dimension of a range space defined by all possible outcomes of a collection of queries. We prove that the VC-dimension is a function of the maximum number of Boolean operations in the selection predicate, and of the maximum number of select and join operations in any individual query in the collection, but it is not a function of the number of queries in the collection. The sample representation computed by our method is typically sufficiently small to be stored in main memory. Once a sample representation is precomputed, it can be used to evaluate the selectivity of multiple queries belonging to the collection. The sample needs to be refreshed only following major changes in the database. We present experimental results validating our theoretical analysis and demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of our technique. We compared the selectivity estimates obtained from the sample with histogram-based estimates obtained from the PostgreSQL query plan optimizer. The results show that the former estimates are more accurate and respect the theoretical guarantees, even with small sample sizes and for complex queries.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1426709257,0,0),(964212,670239,'1102.0469','2011-02-02 15\:59\:03','2011-02-03 01\:02\:01',114038,'Tadataka Watanabe','tadatakawatanabe@hotmail.com',494311,'tex','','Novel Elastic Instabilities within Antiferromagnetically Ordered Phase in the Orbitally-Frustrated Spinel GeCo$_2$O$_4$','Tadataka Watanabe, Shigeo Hara, Shin-Ichi Ikeda, and Keisuke Tomiyasu','cond-mat.str-el','5 pages, 3 figures',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Ultrasound velocity measurements of the orbitally-frustrated GeCo$_2$O$_4$ reveal unusual elastic instabilities due to the phonon-spin coupling within the antiferromagnetic phase.

The line is also observed in cool giant stars. The measured wavelength of the line in stellar spectra is 1318.94 (+,- 0.01) A. Observations of giant stars provide further evidence that this line is not due to N I. It is proposed that this line is a decay from a previously unknown level in S I, which lies above the first ionization limit. This is identified with the 3d singlet D (odd parity) term. The previous tentative assignment of this term to the S I line at 1309.3 A then needs to be revised. The 1309.3 A line has been identified here for the first time in an astrophysical source. The singlet D (odd parity) level could, in principle, be populated by collisions from nearby autoionizing levels that have large number-densities, through population by di-electronic capture. Spin-orbit interaction with the autoionizing triplet D (odd parity) term might also lead to di-electronic capture into the singlet D (odd parity) level.

Most studies fitting observations by means of inhomogeneities also assume spherical symmetry, and thus being at (or very near) the center may imply being located at a very special and unlikely observation point. We argue that such spherical voids should be treated only as a gross first approximation to configurations that follow from a suitable smoothing out of the non-spherical part of the inhomogeneities on angular scales. In this Letter we present a toy construction that supports the above statement. The construction uses parts of the Szekeres model, which is inhomogeneous and anisotropic thus it also addresses the limitations of spherical inhomogeneities. By using the thin-shell approximation (which means that the Israel-Darmois continuity conditions are not fulfilled between the shells) we construct a model of evolving cosmic structures, containing several elongated supercluster-like structures with underdense regions between them, which altogether provides a reasonable coarse-grained description of cosmic structures. While this configuration is not spherically symmetric, its proper volume average yields a spherical void profile of 250 Mpc that roughly agrees with observations. Also, by considering a non-spherical inhomogeneity, the definition of a \"center\" location becomes more nuanced, and thus the constraints placed by fitting observations on our position with respect to this location become less restrictive.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1298941298,1,0),(964245,617063,'1005.1251','2011-02-02 17\:02\:30','2020-03-23 00\:06\:02',1409,'Hong Qian','qian@amath.washington.edu',5470,'tex','1','Thermodynamics of Markov Processes with Non-extensive Entropy and Free Energy','Hong Qian','math-ph math.MP','6 pages',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Phys.

A Z2 symmetry is imposed that enforces a Yukawa structure so that the up quarks, down quarks, and leptons each receive mass from a distinct doublet. This leads to an enhanced coupling of scalars to leptons and allows the model to naturally achieve the required phenomenology in order to explain the gamma ray excess.

Here we outline the development of a self-consistent protocol for messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence that provides constraints and guidelines for the construction of a message in order to maximize the probability that the message effectively communicates. A METI protocol considers several factors including signal encoding, message length, information content, anthropocentrism, transmission method, and transmission periodicity. Once developed, the protocol will be released for testing on different human groups worldwide and across cultural boundaries. An effective message to extraterrestrials should at least be understandable by humans, and releasing the protocol for testing will allow us to improve the protocol and develop potential messages. Through an interactive website, users across the world will be able to create and exchange messages that follow the protocol in order to discover the types of messages better suited for cross-cultural communication. The development of a METI protocol will serve to improve the quality of messages to extraterrestrials, foster international collaboration, and extend astrobiology outreach to the public.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1318204861,1,0),(964254,670269,'1102.0499','2011-02-02 17\:31\:28','2011-04-05 00\:01\:58',31588,'Sonja Schuh','schuh@astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de',34673,'tex','','Exoplanets around G-K Giants','M.P.

Time resolved spectroscopic observations taken during transit show a hump caused by the planet crossing the line profile. From the analysis of the spectra, we derive the radius of the planet and find that it is orbiting retrograde in respect to the spin of the star. Because of its small distance from an A5 star (the orbital period of only 1.22 days), the equilibrium temperature of the planet is estimated to be 2700 K.

A quasi-adiabatic evolution of the circumbinary planets'' orbits during the common-envelope phase would have placed them in unstable configurations, suggesting that they may have suffered significant orbital drag effects and were originally in much larger orbits.

In a recent publication, the lift force has been suggested to be a source to disk tilt, a source that is likely relevant to all accretion disk systems. Lift is generated by slightly different supersonic gas stream speeds flowing over and under the disk at the bright spot. In this conference proceeding, we focus on whether a brown dwarf donor star accreting onto a white dwarf primary has enough mass to contribute to disk tilt. We also would like to obtain whether a white dwarf - brown dwarf close binary system has enough mass to induce and maintain a disk tilt of four degrees. We adopt SDSS 103533.03+055158.4 as our model system which has a mass transfer rate of (10 \\pm 2) x 10-12 M* yr-1. We find that the brown dwarf in SDSS 1035 does not have enough mass to contribute to disk tilt. We find a gross magnitude of the minimum mass transfer rate to be - 10-10 M* yr-1 . We conclude that SDSS 1035 does not seem to have a high enough mass transfer rate to induce and maintain an observable disk tilt. Hence one reason why brown dwarf donor systems may be so difficult to find could be due to their low mass transfer rates which do not induce observable dynamical effects that is typical in white dwarf-red dwarf CVs.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1301961712,1,0),(964270,670285,'1102.0515','2011-02-02 17\:32\:56','2011-04-05 00\:01\:52',31588,'Sonja Schuh','schuh@astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de',154524,'tex','','Identifying A Stars in the CoRoT Fields IRa01, LRa01 and LRa02','D.

Over a period of 3 years, we have observed the SDF on 4 independent epochs with Suprime-Cam on the Subaru 8.2-m telescope, with 2 nights of exposure per epoch, in the R, i'', and z'' bands. We have discovered 150 SNe out to redshift z~2. Using 11 photometric bands from the observer-frame far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, we derive photometric redshifts for the SN host galaxies (for 24 we also have spectroscopic redshifts). This information is combined with the SN photometry to determine the type and redshift distribution of the SN sample. Our final sample includes 26 SNe Ia in the range 1.0<z<1.5 and 10 in the range 1.5<z<2.0. Our SN Ia rate measurements are consistent with those derived from the HST/GOODS sample, but they have statistical uncertainties that are 2-3 times smaller. We find that the SN Ia rate evolution levels off at 1.0<z<2.0, but shows no sign of declining. Combining our SN Ia rate measurements and those from the literature, and comparing to a wide range of possible SFHs, the best-fitting DTD is a power law of the form Psi(t) ~ t^beta, with beta = -0.97 +/- 0.26 (statistical) +/- 0.17 (systematic). This result is consistent with other recent DTD measurements at various redshifts and environments, and is in agreement with a generic prediction of the double-degenerate progenitor scenario for SNe Ia. By combining the contribution to iron production from core-collapse SNe, based on the wide range of SFHs, with that from SNe Ia, calculated with the best-fitting DTD, we predict that the mean present-day cosmic iron abundance is in the range Z(Fe) = (0.06-0.37) Z(Fe,Sun) (abridged).','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1296694942,0,0),(964276,670288,'1102.0518','2011-02-02 17\:48\:56','2011-02-03 01\:02\:22',116038,'Anne Fruehbis-Krueger','anne@math.uni-hannover.de',19952,'tex','1','Zeta-Functions for Families of Calabi--Yau n-folds with Singularities','Anne Fr\\\"uhbis-Kr\\\"uger, Shabnam Kadir','math.AG','22 pages, LaTeX, (including 4 tables)',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'We consider families of Calabi-Yau n-folds containing singular fibres and study relations between the occurring singularity structure and the decomposition of the local Weil zeta-function.

We also obtain analytical expressions linking the degree of thermalization for a given observable with the so-called number of principal components for transition strengths originated at a given energy, or with the dimensions of the whole Hilbert space and microcanonical energy shell and the correlations generated by the observable. As the strength of the residual interaction is increased an order-to-chaos transition takes place, and we show that the onset of Wigner spectral fluctuations, which is the standard signature of chaos, is not sufficient to guarantee thermalization in finite systems. When all the signatures of chaos are fulfilled, including the quasi complete delocalization of eigenfunctions, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is the mechanism responsible for the thermalization of certain types of observables, such as (linear combinations of) occupancies and strength function operators.

In each of the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing radiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In the near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force that prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background spacetime. The field''s action on the particle is difficult to calculate because of its singular nature\: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But it is possible to isolate the field''s singular part and show that it exerts no force on the particle. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is fully responsible for the self-force. The mathematical tools required to derive the equations of motion of a point scalar charge, a point electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background spacetime are developed here from scratch. The review begins with a discussion of the basic theory of bitensors. It then applies the theory to the construction of convenient coordinate systems to chart a neighbourhood of the particle''s word line. It continues with a thorough discussion of Green''s functions in curved spacetime. The review presents a detailed derivation of each of the three equations of motion. Because the notion of a point mass is problematic in general relativity, the review concludes with an alternative derivation of the equations of motion that applies to a small body of arbitrary internal structure.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1426710153,0,0),(964294,670300,'1102.0530','2011-02-02 18\:47\:17','2011-02-03 01\:02\:30',66453,'Ines Brott','i.brott@astro.uu.nl',786299,'tex','','Rotating Massive Main-Sequence Stars I\: Grids of Evolutionary Models and Isochrones','Ines Brott, Selma E. de Mink, Matteo Cantiello, Norbert Langer, Alex de Koter, Chris J.

A straightforward Monte-Carlo routine would enclose the energy constrained manifold within a larger manifold, which is easy to sample, for example, a hypercube. The efficiency of such a sampling routine decreases exponentially with the increase of the dimension of the Hilbert space, because the volume of the enclosing manifold becomes exponentially larger than the volume of the manifold of interest. The present paper explores the ways to optimise the above routine by varying the shapes of the manifolds enclosing the energy-constrained manifold. The resulting improvement in the sampling efficiency is about a factor of five for a 14-dimensional Hilbert space. The advantage of the above algorithm is that it does not compromise on the rigorous statistical nature of the sampling outcome and hence can be used to test other more sophisticated Monte-Carlo routines.

For the present study we select a homogeneous sample covering about 675 square degrees in the direction of the NGP. It contains nearly 670,000 MS stars with apparent magnitudes between 15 and 20.5 mag and spectral classes later than G5. The data were taken from the SDSS. We construct the two-point correlation function (2PCF) for angular separations between 2 and 30 arcsecs. The resulting clustering signal is modeled by means of the Wasserman-Weinberg technique. We show that the distribution of semi-major axis is consistent with the canonical Oepik law and infer that about 10% of all stars in the solar neighbourhood belong to a WB system. To reduce the noise from optical pairs and to increase the sensitivity of the analysis at larger separations, we include distance information from photometric parallaxes. Introducing a novel weighting procedure based on the binding probability of a double star, we infer the distribution of colours and mass ratios, which were carefully corrected for observational selection effects. About 4,000 WBs were taken into account statistically, whose components have masses between 0.2 and 0.85 solar masses. We find that the WB colour distribution is in accord with the colour distribution of single field stars. However, pairs with a mass difference exceeding 0.5 solar masses seem to be systematically underrepresented as compared to a random pairing of field stars. Our results are broadly in agreement with prior studies but a direct comparison is difficult and often impossible.

By comparing the spectrum and the equivalent widths of several atomic and molecular features with those for stars in the IRTF near-infrared library, we revise the spectral type to M2.5V, which is later than usually adopted (K7V). This implies a substantially cooler stellar temperature than previously assumed. Comparison with various pre-main sequence models suggests that TW Hya is only ~3 Myr old; much younger than the usually adopted 8 - 10 Myr. Analysis of the relative strengths of the H lines seen in the spectrum yields estimates for the temperature and density of the emitting region of T_e > 7500 K and n_e ~ 10^{12} - 10^{13} cm^{-3}. The thickness of the emitting region is 10^2 - 10^4 km and the covering fraction is f_\\ast ~ 0.04. Our derived physical parameter values agree with the predictions of the magnetospheric accretion scenario. The highest signal-to-noise H lines have profiles that indicate multiple emission components. We derive an excess spectrum (above that of the M2.5V template) that peaks in the H band. Although our derived veiling values, ~ 0.1, agree with previous estimates, the excess spectrum does not match that of current models in which this flux is generated by an inner optically thin disk.

However, the synchrotron emission from a collimated outflow (the standard jet model) has difficulties in accounting for the lower-energy afterglow emission, where a simultaneous break occurs at 2 ks in the optical and X-ray light-curves, but with the optical flux decay (before and after the break) being much slower than in the X-rays (at same time). The measured X-ray and GeV fluxes are incompatible with the higher-energy afterglow emission being from same spectral component as the lower-energy afterglow emission, which suggests a synchrotron self-Compton model for this afterglow. Cessation of energy injection in the blast-wave and an ambient medium with a wind-like n ~ r^{-2} density can explain all features of the optical and X-ray light-curves of GRB afterglow 090510.

Therefore a massively parallel probe storage device is an example of a noisy communication channel with long range correlations between channel outputs due to the global positioning errors. We find that these correlations have a profound effect on the channel''s properties. For example, it turns out that the channel''s information capacity does approach 1 bit per probe in the limit of high signal-to-noise ratio, but the rate of the approach is only polynomial in the channel noise strength. Moreover, any error correction code with block size N >> 1 such that codewords correspond to the instantaneous outputs of the all probes in the array exhibits an error floor independently of the code rate.

We characterize herein the dynamical properties of these candidate multi-planet systems. We find that virtually all systems are stable, as tested by numerical integration assuming a mass-radius relationship. The distribution of observed period ratios is also clustered just outside resonances, particularly the 2\:1 resonance. Neither of these characteristics would emerge if the systems were significantly contaminated with false positives, and these combined with other considerations strongly suggest that the majority of these multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. Using the observed multiplicity frequencies (e.g., the ratio of three-candidate systems to two-candidate systems), we find that a single population that matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number of singly-transiting systems. We provide constraints on the true multiplicity and mutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, which includes a population of systems with multiple small planets with low (less than 5 degrees) inclinations.

We perform a transit timing analysis of the Kepler planet candidates. We find that at least ~12% of planet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive of TTVs, representing at least ~65 TTV candidates. In all cases, the time span of observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet masses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple transiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). We find that the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does not vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per star, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a single transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. We anticipate that Kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems with multiple transiting planet candidates via TTVs. Thus, TTVs will provide a powerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital dynamics of low-mass planets. If Kepler observations were extended to at least six years, then TTVs would provide much more precise constraints on the dynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitive to planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-type stars.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1426710188,0,0),(964317,670315,'1102.0545','2011-02-02 20\:12\:57','2011-02-03 01\:02\:41',121439,'Biplob Bhattacherjee','bbhattacherjee@gmail.com',130299,'tex','','Top quark forward-backward asymmetry at Tevatron and its implications at the LHC','Biplob Bhattacherjee, Sudhansu S.

The discovery of hundreds of exoplanet candidates by NASA''s Kepler mission enables astronomers to characterize the eccentricity distribution of small exoplanets. Measuring the eccentricity of individual planets is only practical in favorable cases that are amenable to complementary techniques (e.g., radial velocities, transit timing variations, occultation photometry). Yet even in the absence of individual eccentricities, it is possible to study the distribution of eccentricities based on the distribution of transit durations (relative to the maximum transit duration for a circular orbit). We analyze the transit duration distribution of Kepler planet candidates. We find that for host stars with T_eff > 5100 K we cannot invert this to infer the eccentricity distribution at this time due to uncertainties and possible systematics in the host star densities. With this limitation in mind, we compare the observed transit duration distribution with models to rule out extreme distributions. If we assume a Rayleigh eccentricity distribution for Kepler planet candidates, then we find best-fits with a mean eccentricity of 0.1-0.25 for host stars with T_eff < 5100 K. We compare the transit duration distribution for different subsets of Kepler planet candidates and discuss tentative trends with planetary radius and multiplicity. High-precision spectroscopic follow-up observations for a large sample of host stars will be required to confirm which trends are real and which are the results of systematic errors in stellar radii. Finally, we identify planet candidates that must be eccentric or have a significantly underestimated stellar radius.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',1,1432738935,1,0),(964320,649677,'1010.5013','2011-02-02 20\:20\:21','2011-02-23 15\:19\:56',97191,'Tiago Mariz','tmariz@if.ufal.br',43383,'tex','','Radiatively induced Lorentz-violating operator of mass dimension five in QED','T.

Such theory, under appropriate conditions, has been proved to be equivalent to a Lorentzian spacetime structure, where the metric tensor satisfies Einstein field equations. Here, we first recall that according to quantum field theory ideas gravitation is described by a Lagrangian theory of a possible massive graviton field (generated by matter fields and coupling also to itself) living in Minkowski spacetime. The graviton field is moreover supposed to be represented by a symmetric tensor field h carrying the representations of spin two and zero of the Lorentz group. Such a field, then (as it is well known), must necessarily satisfy the gauge condition given by Eq.(3) below. Next, we introduce an ansatz relating h to the 1-form fields g^a. Then, using the Clifford bundle formalism we derive, from our Lagrangian theory, the exact wave equation for the graviton and investigate the role of the gauge condition given by Eq.(3) in obtaining a reliable conservation law for the energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational plus the matter fields in Minkowski spacetime. Finally we ask the question\: does Eq.(3) fix any gauge condition for the field g of the effective Lorentzian spacetime structure that represents the field h in our theory? We show that no gauge condition is fixed a priory, as is the case in General Relativity. Moreover we investigate under which conditions we may fix Logunov gauge condition.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',5,1296746458,0,0),(964322,670318,'1102.0548','2011-02-02 20\:26\:43','2011-02-03 01\:02\:43',108535,'Bo Yang','yangbopku@gmail.com',3664,'tex','1','A lower bound for the scalar curvature of noncompact nonflat Ricci shrinkers','Bennett Chow, Peng Lu, and Bo Yang','math.DG','2 pages',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'We show that recent work of Ni and Wilking yields the result that a noncompact nonflat Ricci shrinker has at most quadratic scalar curvature decay.

The conventional matching procedure coupled with the integral Lippmann-Schwinger equations technique are used in the formal theoretical basis of this approach. The reformulated scattering problem is suitable for application in the exterior complex scaling technique\: the practical advantage is that after the complex scaling the problem is reduced to a boundary problem with zero boundary conditions.

It is difficult to solve the six-dimensional time-dependent transfer equation unless the problem is highly symmetric or in equilibrium. When the radiation field is smooth, it is natural to take angular moments of the transfer equation to reduce the degrees of freedom. However, low order moment equations contain terms that depend on higher order moments. To close the system of moment equations, approximations are made to truncate this hierarchy. Popular closures used in astrophysics include flux limited diffusion and the M1 closure, which are rather ad hoc and do not necessarily capture the correct physics.

The observations are obtained in the near infrared with Spitzer Space Telescope and at optical wavelengths by combining more than a year of Kepler photometry. The investigation consists of constraining the eccentricities of these systems and of obtaining broad band emergent spectra for individual planets. For both targets, the occultations are detected at 3 sigma level at each wavelength with mid-occultation times consistent with circular orbits. The brightness temperatures of these planets are deduced from the infrared observations and reach T=1930+/-100K and T=1660+/-120K for Kepler-5b and Kepler-6b respectively. We measure optical geometric albedos A_g in the Kepler bandpass and find A_g=0.12+/-0.04 for Kepler-5b and A_g=0.11+/-0.04 for Kepler-6b leading to an upper limit for the Bond albedo of A_B < 0.17 in both cases. The observations for both planets are best described by models for which most of the incident energy is redistributed on the dayside, with only less than 10% of the absorbed stellar flux redistributed to the night side of these planets. The data for Kepler-5b favor a model without a temperature inversion, whereas for Kepler-6b they do not allow distinguishing between models with and without inversion.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1432738936,1,0),(964406,670199,'1102.0429','2011-02-03 03\:40\:51','2011-02-04 01\:00\:39',120005,'Beno\\^it Stroh','benoit.stroh@gmail.com',45663,'tex','','Sur une conjecture de Kottwitz au bord','Benoit Stroh','math.AG math.NT',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'We are interested in the intersection cohomology of the minimal compactification of Siegel modular varieties at some places of bad reduction.

We demonstrate that a net difference of ~0.5Mm in the supergranular emission length-scale occurs when comparing observations cycle 22/23 and cycle 23/24 minima. This variation in scale is reproduced in the datasets of multiple space- and ground-based instruments and using different diagnostic measures. By means of extension, we consider the variation of the supergranular length-scale over multiple solar minima by analyzing a subset of the Mt Wilson Solar Observatory (MWO) Ca II K image record. The observations and analysis presented provide a tantalizing look at solar activity in the absence of large-scale flux emergence, offering insight into times of \"extreme\" solar minimum and general behavior such as the phasing and cross-dependence of different components of the spectral irradiance.

This leads to an enhanced coupling of scalars to leptons and allows the model to naturally achieve the required phenomenology in order to explain the gamma ray excess. Our model yields the correct dark matter thermal relic density and avoids collider bounds from measurements of the Z width as well as direct production at LEP.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1304950802,0,0),(965700,664289,'1101.0600','2011-02-07 20\:58\:24','2011-02-08 01\:04\:11',28630,'Zhi-Wei Sun','zwsun@nju.edu.cn',11998,'tex','1','On sums related to central binomial and trinomial coefficients','Zhi-Wei Sun','math.NT math.CA math.CO','27 pages.

This length-scale reflects the radiative energy in the plasma of the upper solar chromosphere and transition region at the magnetic network boundaries forming as a result of the relentless interaction of magnetic fields and convective motions of the Sun''s interior. We demonstrate that a net difference of ~0.5Mm in the supergranular emission length-scale occurs when comparing observations cycle 22/23 and cycle 23/24 minima. This variation in scale is reproduced in the datasets of multiple space- and ground-based instruments and using different diagnostic measures. By means of extension, we consider the variation of the supergranular length-scale over multiple solar minima by analyzing a subset of the Mt Wilson Solar Observatory (MWO) Ca II K image record. The observations and analysis presented provide a tantalizing look at solar activity in the absence of large-scale flux emergence, offering insight into times of \"extreme\" solar minimum and general behavior such as the phasing and cross-dependence of different components of the spectral irradiance. Given that the modulation of the supergranular scale imprints itself in variations of the Sun''s spectral irradiance, as well as in the mass and energy transport into the entire outer atmosphere, this preliminary investigation is an important step in understanding the impact of the quiet sun on the heliospheric system.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',3,1432738910,1,0),(965868,670133,'1102.0363','2011-02-08 08\:52\:12','2011-02-09 01\:01\:12',158206,'Chandrasheel Bhagwat Mr.','chandra@math.tifr.res.in',6922,'tex','1','On a strong multiplicity one property for the length spectra of even dimensional compact hyperbolic spaces','Chandrasheel Bhagwat, C.S.Rajan','math.NT math.DG',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'We prove a strong multiplicity one theorem for the length spectrum of compact even dimensional hyperbolic spaces i.e. if all but finitely many closed geodesics for two compact even dimensional hyperbolic spaces have the same length, then all closed geodesics have the same length.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1297213272,1,0),(966097,670299,'1102.0529','2011-02-08 18\:55\:11','2015-03-18 20\:22\:38',15185,'Eric Poisson','poisson@physics.uoguelph.ca',532702,'pdftex','','The motion of point particles in curved spacetime','Eric Poisson, Adam Pound, and Ian Vega','gr-qc','161 pages.

In each of the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing radiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In the near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force that prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background spacetime. The field''s action on the particle is difficult to calculate because of its singular nature\: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But it is possible to isolate the field''s singular part and show that it exerts no force on the particle. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is fully responsible for the self-force. The mathematical tools required to derive the equations of motion of a point scalar charge, a point electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background spacetime are developed here from scratch. The review begins with a discussion of the basic theory of bitensors. It then applies the theory to the construction of convenient coordinate systems to chart a neighbourhood of the particle''s word line. It continues with a thorough discussion of Green''s functions in curved spacetime. The review presents a detailed derivation of each of the three equations of motion. Because the notion of a point mass is problematic in general relativity, the review concludes with an alternative derivation of the equations of motion that applies to a small body of arbitrary internal structure.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1426710158,0,0),(966142,561844,'0907.2974','2011-02-08 20\:58\:18','2011-02-09 01\:02\:58',130271,'Serguei Mokhov','mokhov@cse.concordia.ca',1632045,'pdftex','','Service-Oriented Architectures and Web Services\: Course Tutorial Notes','Serguei A.

Spin clusters serve as ideal candidates for the implementation of some of the associated protocols. In this paper, we consider a symmetric spin trimer and a tetramer, which describe a number of known molecular magnets, and compute the quantum discord in the ground and thermal states of the clusters. The variations of the quantum discord as a function of anisotropy parameter, magnetic field and temperature are investigated. We obtain a number of interesting results such as a finite value of the quantum discord in the trimer ground state for which the pairwise entanglement is known to be zero, differences in the nature of some of the variations in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases and discontinuous jumps in the magnitude of the quantum discord at first order quantum phase transition points. A remarkable feature that is observed is that the quantum discord completely vanishes only in the asymptotic limit of temperature $T\\rightarrow\\infty$. We further study the dynamics of the quantum discord and the pairwise entanglement at T=0 under the effect of a dephasing channel describing the interaction of the reduced spin cluster state with independent local environments. The QD is found to vanish asymptotically as $t\\rightarrow\\infty$. In the case of the spin trimer, the pairwise entanglement has a zero value at all times and reaches a zero value in a finite time in the case of the tetramer.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',3,1432110015,1,0),(966755,670209,'1102.0439','2011-02-10 12\:20\:25','2011-02-11 01\:01\:44',123107,'Lin Chen','cqtcl@nus.edu.sg',76659,'tex','','Classification of pure tripartite states by reduced bipartite densities','Masahito Hayashi and Lin Chen','quant-ph','5 pages, 1 table, 1 figure, improved the presentation and added a few references',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'We study the structure of tripartite pure states $\\ket{\\ps}_{ABC}$ in terms of the fact that its bipartite reduced density operators $\\r_{AB}, \\r_{BC}$ and $\\r_{AC}$ are in either of the four cases\: separable states, non-separable positive-partial-transpose (PPT) states, non-PPT reduction states that satisfy the reduction criterion, and non-reduction states.

However, the drizzle algorithm was developed with small, faint, partially resolved sources in mind, and is not the best possible algorithm for high signal-to-noise unresolved objects. Here, a new method for creating band-limited images from undersampled data is presented. The method uses a drizzled image as a first order approximation and then rapidly converges toward a band-limited image which fits the data given the statistical weighting provided by the drizzled image. The method, named iDrizzle, for iterative Drizzle, effectively eliminates both the small high-frequency artifacts and convolution with an interpolant kernel that can be introduced by drizzling. The method works well in the presence of geometric distortion, and can easily handle cosmic rays, bad pixels, or other missing data. It can combine images taken with random dithers, though the number of dithers required to obtain a good final image depends in part on the quality of the dither placements. iDrizzle may prove most beneficial for producing high-fidelity point spread functions from undersampled images, and could be particularly valuable for future Dark Energy missions such as WFIRST and EUCLID, which will likely attempt to do high precision supernova photometry and lensing experiments with undersampled detectors.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1432738908,1,0),(969361,670258,'1102.0488','2011-02-18 08\:05\:53','2011-05-19 00\:02\:47',167946,'John Claridge Dr','j.b.claridge@liv.ac.uk',1492178,'pdf','1','Cation vacancy order in the K0.8+xFe1.6-ySe2 system\: five-fold cell expansion accommodates 20% tetrahedral vacancies','J.

There are 115 targets with two candidate transiting planets, 45 with three, 8 with four, and one each with five and six. We characterize herein the dynamical properties of these candidate multi-planet systems. The distribution of observed period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs are neither in nor near low-order mean motion resonances. Nonetheless, there are small but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both in resonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularly near the 2\:1 resonance. We find that virtually all candidate systems are stable, as tested by numerical integrations (assuming a nominal mass-radius relationship). Several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority of these multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. Using the observed multiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population that matches the higher multiplicities generally underpredicts the number of singly-transiting systems. We provide constraints on the true multiplicity and mutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, revealing a population of systems with multiple small planets with low (1-5 degree) mutual inclinations. In all, multi-transiting systems from Kepler provide a large and rich dataset that can be used to powerfully test theoretical predictions of the formation and evolution of planetary systems.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1426710183,0,0),(971333,670068,'1102.0298','2011-02-24 16\:11\:35','2011-07-14 14\:19\:36',80674,'Suvankar Dutta','suvankar.hri@gmail.com',56905,'pdftex','','Geometry and Phase Structure of Non-Relativistic Branes','Nabamita Banerjee, Suvankar Dutta and Dileep P.

There are 115 targets with two candidate transiting planets, 45 with three, 8 with four, and one each with five and six. We characterize herein the dynamical properties of these candidate multi-planet systems. The distribution of observed period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs are neither in nor near low-order mean motion resonances. Nonetheless, there are small but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both in resonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularly near the 2\:1 resonance. We find that virtually all candidate systems are stable, as tested by numerical integrations (assuming a nominal mass-radius relationship). Several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority of these multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. Using the observed multiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population that matches the higher multiplicities generally underpredicts the number of singly-transiting systems. We provide constraints on the true multiplicity and mutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, revealing a population of systems with multiple small planets with low (1-5 degree) mutual inclinations. In all, multi-transiting systems from Kepler provide a large and rich dataset that can be used to powerfully test theoretical predictions of the formation and evolution of planetary systems.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',3,1426710184,0,0),(971996,669112,'1101.5423','2011-02-27 03\:52\:24','2011-03-03 15\:19\:29',55806,'Fei Wang','Fei.Wang@sci.monash.edu.au',20746,'tex','1','Realistic Standard Model Fermion Mass Relations in Generalized Minimal Supergravity (GmSUGRA)','Csaba Balazs, Tianjun Li, Dimitri V.

The AdS/CFT dictionary allows us to calculate this thermodynamic entropy as the horizon entropy of a certain topological black hole.

In such situations a prior distribution derived from the prior of Zellner can be used, by introducing a ridge parameter. The prior obtained is a flexible and simple adaptation of the g-prior, and can be linked to the work of Gupta and Ibrahim (2007). In this paper a simple way to choose the associated hyper-parameters is proposed, and a full variable selection method using this prior is developed for probit mixed models.

There are 1235 planetary candidates with transit like signatures detected in this period. These are associated with 997 host stars. Distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separated into five class-sizes; 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size (radius < 1.25 Earth radii), 288 super-Earth size (1.25 Earth radii < radius < 2 Earth radii), 662 Neptune-size (2 Earth radii < radius < 6 Earth radii), 165 Jupiter-size (6 Earth radii < radius < 15 Earth radii), and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter (15 Earth radii < radius < 22 Earth radii). In the temperature range appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Five are less than twice the size of the Earth. Over 74% of the planetary candidates are smaller than Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates increases to a peak at two to three times Earth-size and then declines inversely proportional to area of the candidate. Our current best estimates of the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting for geometric and sensitivity biases, are 6% for Earth-size candidates, 7% for super-Earth size candidates, 17% for Neptune-size candidates, and 4% for Jupiter-size candidates. Multi-candidate, transiting systems are frequent; 17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 33.9% of all the candidates are part of multi-candidate systems.','http\://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/',2,1589846723,1,0),(976634,670159,'1102.0389','2011-03-14 09\:54\:08','2011-03-15 00\:03\:00',55596,'Jean-Marc Aza\\\"{\\i}s','azais@cict.fr',217148,'tex','','Rice formulae and Gaussian waves','Jean-Marc Aza\\\"is, Jos\\''e R.

The Pilch-Warner background introduces new divergences into the D7-branes free energy, which we are able to remove with a single counterterm. We find a family of D7-brane embeddings in the geometry and discuss their properties. We study the physics of the quark condensate, constituent quark mass, and part of the meson spectrum.

A hierarchical framework coherently models multiple random and uncertain effects, including intrinsic supernova light curve covariances, dust extinction and reddening, and distances. An improved BayeSN MCMC code computes probabilistic inferences for the hierarchical model by sampling the global probability density of parameters describing individual supernovae and the population. We have applied this hierarchical model to optical and NIR data of 127 SN Ia from PAIRITEL, CfA3, CSP, and the literature. We find an apparent population correlation between the host galaxy extinction A_V and the the ratio of total-to-selective dust absorption R_V. For SN with low dust extinction, A_V < 0.4, we find R_V = 2.5 - 2.9, while at high extinctions, A_V > 1, low values of R_V < 2 are favored. The NIR luminosities are excellent standard candles and are less sensitive to dust extinction. They exhibit low correlation with optical peak luminosities, and thus provide independent information on distances. The combination of NIR and optical data constrains the dust extinction and improves the predictive precision of individual SN Ia distances by about 60%. Using cross-validation, we estimate an rms distance modulus prediction error of 0.11 mag for SN with optical and NIR data versus 0.15 mag for SN with optical data alone. Continued study of SN Ia in the NIR is important for improving their utility as precise and accurate cosmological distance indicators.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',3,1426602469,1,0),(984165,648235,'1010.3571','2011-04-06 10\:44\:08','2013-05-29 19\:51\:46',133399,'Yu Watanabe','watanabe@cat.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp',428307,'pdftex','','Uncertainty Relation Revisited from Quantum Estimation Theory','Yu Watanabe, Takahiro Sagawa, and Masahito Ueda','quant-ph','manuscript including 4 pages and 2 figures',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'10.1103/PhysRevA.84.042121','By invoking quantum estimation theory we formulate bounds of errors in quantum measurement for arbitrary quantum states and observables in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.

The asymmetry of the dynamics implies the failure of the detailed balance condition. The functional form of the rate at which an individual spin changes its state is constrained by the global balance condition with respect to the equilibrium measure of the Ising chain. The local magnetization, the equal-time and two-time correlation functions and the linear response to an external magnetic field obey linear equations which are solved explicitly. The behaviour of these quantities and the relation between the correlation and response functions are analyzed both in the stationary state and in the zero-temperature scaling regime. In the stationary state, a transition between two behaviours of the correlation function occurs when the amplitude of the asymmetry crosses a critical value, with the consequence that the limit fluctuation-dissipation ratio decays continuously from the value 1, for the equilibrium state in the absence of asymmetry, to 0 for this critical value.

Thus, we used two different experimental methods to produce micrometer-sized water ice particles, i. e. by spraying water droplets into liquid nitrogen and by spraying water droplets into a cold nitrogen atmosphere.

We also analyze new and archival NB4980 imaging tuned to the wavelength of the Lya emission line at z=3.09, and archival broadband B, V, and R images of the non-ionizing UV continuum. Our NB3640 images contain 26 z>3.06 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) as well as a set of 130 Lya emitters (LAEs), identified by their excess NB4980 flux relative to the BV continuum. Six LBGs and 28 LAEs are detected in the NB3640 image. LBGs appear to span a range of NB3640-R colors, while LAEs appear bimodal in their NB3640-R properties. We estimate average UV to LyC flux density ratios, corrected for foreground contamination and intergalactic medium absorption, finding <F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LBG} = 11.3^{+10.3}_{-5.4}, which implies a LBG LyC escape fraction f_{esc}^{LyC} ~ 0.1, and <F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LAE} = 2.2^{+0.9}_{-0.6}. The strikingly blue LAE flux density ratios defy interpretation in terms of standard stellar population models.

If we assume that <F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LAE} holds at the faintest luminosities, the galaxy contribution significantly exceeds that inferred from the Lya forest.

In this paper we present such a dark matter model by extending the MSSM to include four Higgs doublets and one scalar singlet. A Z2 symmetry is imposed that enforces a Yukawa structure so that the up quarks, down quarks, and leptons each receive mass from a distinct doublet. This leads to an enhanced coupling of scalars to leptons and allows the model to naturally achieve the required phenomenology in order to explain the gamma ray excess.

We identify the multijet plus E_T^miss signal as the optimal channel and determine the discovery potential in the first run. The second class has heavier gluinos and squarks but the LSP has a significant Higgsino component and should be seen by the next generation of direct dark matter detection experiments. The combined information from the 7 TeV LHC run and the next generation of direct detection experiments can test almost all of the CMSSM parameter space consistent with dark matter and EW constraints, corresponding to a fine-tuning not worse than 1\:100.

The parameters of the nonlocal model are refitted so that the physical values of the pion mass and the weak pion decay constant are obtained. The size of the 1/Nc correction to the quark condensate is carefully studied and compared with the usual local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. It is found that even the sign of the corrections can be different. This can be attributed to the mesonic cut-off of the local model. The model is also applied to finite temperature. We find that the 1/Nc corrections dominate the melting of the chiral condensate at low temperatures, T<100 MeV, in agreement with chiral perturbation theory. On the other hand, the relative importance of the 1/Nc corrections in the cross-over regime depends on the parameter T0 of the Polyakov loop potential. For T0=270 MeV, corresponding to a fit of lattice data for pure gluodynamics, the correction terms are large and lead to a lowering of the chiral phase transition temperature in comparison with the mean-field result. Near the phase transition the 1/Nc expansion breaks down and a non-perturbative scheme is needed to include mesonic correlations in that regime. Lowering T0 leads to a more rapid cross-over even at the mean-field level and the unstable region for the 1/Nc corrections shrinks.

In such situations a prior distribution derived from the prior of Zellner can be used, by introducing a ridge parameter. The prior obtained is a flexible and simple adaptation of the g-prior, and can be linked to the work of Gupta and Ibrahim (2007).

As a first step in this direction we present the observation of quantized conductance at integer multiples of 2e^2/h at zero magnetic field and 4.2 K temperature in a high mobility suspended graphene ballistic nanoconstriction.

We present the results of a SN survey in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF). Over a period of 3 years, we have observed the SDF on 4 independent epochs with Suprime-Cam on the Subaru 8.2-m telescope, with 2 nights of exposure per epoch, in the R, i'', and z'' bands. We have discovered 150 SNe out to redshift z~2. Using 11 photometric bands from the observer-frame far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, we derive photometric redshifts for the SN host galaxies (for 24 we also have spectroscopic redshifts). This information is combined with the SN photometry to determine the type and redshift distribution of the SN sample. Our final sample includes 28 SNe Ia in the range 1.0<z<1.5 and 10 in the range 1.5<z<2.0. Our SN Ia rate measurements are consistent with those derived from the HST/GOODS sample, but the overall uncertainty of our 1.5<z<2.0 measurement is a factor of 2 smaller, of 35-50%. We find that the SN Ia rate evolution levels off at 1.0<z<2.0, but shows no sign of declining. Combining our SN Ia rate measurements and those from the literature, and comparing to a wide range of possible SFHs, the best-fit DTD is a power law of the form Psi(t) ~ t^beta, with beta = -1.1 +/- 0.1 (statistical) +/- 0.17 (systematic). This result is consistent with other recent DTD measurements at various redshifts and environments, and is in agreement with a generic prediction of the double-degenerate progenitor scenario for SNe Ia. By combining the contribution to iron production from core-collapse SNe, based on the wide range of SFHs, with that from SNe Ia, calculated with the best-fit DTD, we predict that the mean present-day cosmic iron abundance is in the range Z(Fe) = (0.09-0.37) Z(Fe,Sun) (abridged).','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',3,1432738853,1,0),(1008539,670106,'1102.0336','2011-06-22 07\:23\:01','2011-06-23 00\:01\:29',103516,'Joachim Toft jto','joachim.toft@lnu.se',57963,'tex','1','The Bargmann transform on a broad family of Banach spaces, with applications to Toeplitz and pseudo-differential operators','Joachim Toft','math.FA math.AP math.CV',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'We investigate mapping properties for the Bargmann transform on modulation spaces whose weights and their reciprocals are allowed to grow faster than exponentials.

We note, however, that the broken-links network formed in the model is less clustered than our experimental observations, indicating that the model reflects less localized breakage events and does not fully capture the dynamics of the granular flow.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1345161658,1,0),(1010435,645437,'1010.0773','2011-06-28 09\:05\:38','2012-11-27 01\:01\:07',4976,'Viet Chi Tran','chi.tran@math.univ-lille1.fr',445139,'tex','','The 2d-Directed Spanning Forest is almost surely a tree','David Coupier (LPP), Viet Chi Tran (LPP, CMAP)','math.PR','6 figures','ccsd',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Random Structures and Algorithms 42, 1 (2013) 59-72','10.1002/rsa.20400','We consider the Directed Spanning Forest (DSF) constructed as follows\: given a Poisson point process N on the plane, the ancestor of each point is the nearest vertex of N having a strictly larger abscissa.

NASA''s Kepler mission has identified 1235 transiting planet candidates (Borcuki et al 2011). The method of transit timing variations (TTVs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetary systems (Holman et al. 2010; Lissauer et al. 2011a). We perform a transit timing analysis of the Kepler planet candidates. We find that at least ~12% of planet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive of TTVs, representing at least ~65 TTV candidates. In all cases, the time span of observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet masses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple transiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). We find that the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does not vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per star, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a single transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. We anticipate that Kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems with multiple transiting planet candidates via TTVs. Thus, TTVs will provide a powerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital dynamics of low-mass planets. If Kepler observations were extended to at least six years, then TTVs would provide much more precise constraints on the dynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitive to planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-type stars.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1426710190,1,0),(1015736,670120,'1102.0350','2011-07-13 20\:40\:37','2011-08-05 00\:00\:32',129354,'Yi Zhang','zhangyi@berkeley.edu',412722,'tex','','Entanglement entropy of critical spin liquids','Yi Zhang, Tarun Grover and Ashvin Vishwanath','cond-mat.str-el','4+ pages, 2 figures, to be published in PRL',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Phys.

Although the wavefunctions are not sign positive, $S_2$ can be calculated on relatively large systems (>324 spins), using the variational Monte Carlo technique. On the triangular lattice we find that entanglement entropy of the projected Fermi-sea state violates the boundary law, with $S_2$ enhanced by a logarithmic factor.

It is difficult to assess the reliability of our log(Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it is poor, particularly at extreme Teff.

The distribution of observed period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs are neither in nor near low-order mean motion resonances. Nonetheless, there are small but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both in resonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularly near the 2\:1 resonance. We find that virtually all candidate systems are stable, as tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radius relationship. Several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority of these multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. Using the observed multiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population of planetary systems that matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number of singly-transiting systems. We provide constraints on the true multiplicity and mutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, revealing a population of systems with multiple super-Earth-size and Neptune-size planets with low to moderate mutual inclinations.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',4,1432738935,1,0),(1023293,652619,'1011.1651','2011-08-06 15\:09\:27','2015-05-19 00\:03\:58',89490,'Agissilaos Athanassoulis','agis.athanassoulis@gmail.com',44063,'pdftex','','Strong and weak semiclassical limits for some rough Hamiltonians','Agissilaos Athanassoulis, Thierry Paul','math.AP',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences Next Article > Volume 22, Issue 12, December 2012','10.1142/S0218202512500388','We present several results concerning the semiclassical limit of the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation with potentials whose regularity doesn''t guarantee the uniqueness of the underlying classical flow.

We leverage on this result and develop a method that, given a class of queries, builds a concise random sample of a database, such that with high probability the execution of any query in the class on the sample provides an accurate estimate for the selectivity of the query on the original large database. The error probability holds simultaneously for the selectivity estimates of all queries in the collection, thus the same sample can be used to evaluate the selectivity of multiple queries, and the sample needs to be refreshed only following major changes in the database. The sample representation computed by our method is typically sufficiently small to be stored in main memory. We present extensive experimental results, validating our theoretical analysis and demonstrating the advantage of our technique when compared to complex selectivity estimation techniques used in PostgreSQL and the Microsoft SQL Server.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',3,1426709261,1,0),(1025506,670139,'1102.0369','2011-08-14 15\:53\:22','2011-08-16 00\:02\:15',167918,'Georgios Fellouris Dr.','fellouri@usc.edu',30216,'tex','1','Asymptotically optimal parameter estimation under communication constraints','Georgios Fellouris','stat.ME math.ST stat.TH','28 pages',NULL,NULL,'62L12, 62F30 (Primary), 62F12, 62M05, 62M09 (Secondary)',NULL,NULL,NULL,'The parameter estimation problem is considered for a linear continuous time semimartingale regression model.

To this end, we solve the cellular dynamical mean-field equations for the two-dimensional Hubbard model using a plaquette as the reference quantum impurity model and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method as impurity solver. The normal-state phase diagram as a function of interaction strength $U$, temperature $T$, and filling $n$ shows that, upon increasing $n$ towards the Mott insulator, there is a surface of first-order transition between two metals at nonzero doping. That surface ends at a finite temperature critical line originating at the half-filled Mott critical point. Associated with this transition, there is a maximum in scattering rate as well as thermodynamic signatures. These findings suggest a new scenario for the normal-state phase diagram of the high temperature superconductors. The criticality surmised in these systems can originate not from a T=0 quantum critical point, nor from the proximity of a long-range ordered phase, but from a low temperature transition between two types of metals at finite doping.

In each of the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing radiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In the near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force that prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background spacetime. The field''s action on the particle is difficult to calculate because of its singular nature\: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But it is possible to isolate the field''s singular part and show that it exerts no force on the particle. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is fully responsible for the self-force. The mathematical tools required to derive the equations of motion of a point scalar charge, a point electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background spacetime are developed here from scratch. The review begins with a discussion of the basic theory of bitensors. It then applies the theory to the construction of convenient coordinate systems to chart a neighbourhood of the particle''s word line. It continues with a thorough discussion of Green''s functions in curved spacetime. The review presents a detailed derivation of each of the three equations of motion. Because the notion of a point mass is problematic in general relativity, the review concludes with an alternative derivation of the equations of motion that applies to a small body of arbitrary internal structure.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',3,1432738932,1,0),(1039940,561844,'0907.2974','2011-09-26 20\:00\:05','2011-09-28 00\:00\:18',130271,'Serguei Mokhov','mokhov@cse.concordia.ca',1653709,'pdftex','','Service-Oriented Architectures and Web Services\: Course Tutorial Notes','Serguei A.

By means of exact diagonalizations we analyze the relevance of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis as well as the influence of other factors, like the energy and structure of the initial state, or the dimension of the Hilbert space. We also obtain analytical expressions linking the degree of thermalization for a given observable with the so-called number of principal components for transition strengths originated at a given energy, with the dimensions of the whole Hilbert space and microcanonical energy shell, and with the correlations generated by the observable. As the strength of the residual interaction is increased an order-to-chaos transition takes place, and we show that the onset of Wigner spectral fluctuations, which is the standard signature of chaos, is not sufficient to guarantee thermalization in finite systems. When all the signatures of chaos are fulfilled, including the quasi complete delocalization of eigenfunctions, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is the mechanism responsible for the thermalization of certain types of observables, such as (linear combinations of) occupancies and strength function operators.

An explicit integral representation of the function $A^*(t)$, which minimizes a weighted $L^2$-distance between the logarithm of the copula $C(y^{1-t},y^t)$ and functions of the form $A(t)\\log(y)$ is derived. If the unknown copula is an extreme-value copula, the function $A^*(t)$ coincides with Pickands dependence function. Moreover, even if this is not the case, the function $A^*(t)$ always satisfies the boundary conditions of a Pickands dependence function. The estimators are obtained by replacing the unknown copula by its empirical counterpart and weak convergence of the corresponding process is shown. A comparison with the commonly used estimators is performed from a theoretical point of view and by means of a simulation study. Our asymptotic and numerical results indicate that some of the new estimators outperform the estimators, which were recently proposed by Genest and Segers [Ann. Statist. 37 (2009) 2990--3022].

We concentrate on the case when the Galois representation is ordinary at p and we give a corresponding list of Serre weights. When the representation is moreover tamely ramified at p, we conjecture that all weights of this list are modular, otherwise we describe a subset of weights on the list that should be modular.

These predictions were based on the idea that the transverse nuclear spin decays evolve in a manner governed at long times by the slowest decaying eigenmode of the quantum system, analogous to a chaotic resonance in a classical system. The present paper extends the above investigations both theoretically and experimentally. On the theoretical side, the notion of chaotic eigenmodes is used to make predictions about the relationships between the long-time oscillation phase of the nuclear free induction decay (FID) and the amplitudes and phases of spin echoes. On the experimental side, the above predictions are tested for the nuclear spin decays of F-19 in CaF2 crystals and Xe-129 in frozen xenon.

When $E[X_1] > 0$ and the distribution of $Z_N = \\sum_{i=1}^N C_i$ is also IR, we obtain the asymptotics $$P(M_N > x) \\sim P(S_N > x) \\sim E[\\sum_{i=1}^N \\bar{F}(x/C_i)] + P(Z_N > x/E[X_1]).$$ For completeness, when the distribution of $Z_N$ is IR and heavier than $\\bar{F}$, we also obtain conditions under which the asymptotic relations $$P(M_N > x) \\sim P(S_N > x) \\sim P(Z_N > x/E[X_1])$$ hold.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',3,1334707435,1,0),(1114233,670139,'1102.0369','2012-04-24 07\:17\:34','2012-04-25 00\:02\:29',167918,'Georgios Fellouris Dr.','fellouri@usc.edu',35417,'tex','1','Asymptotically optimal parameter estimation under communication constraints','Georgios Fellouris','stat.ME math.ST stat.TH','26 pages',NULL,NULL,'62L12, 62F30 (Primary), 62F12, 62M05, 62M09 (Secondary)',NULL,NULL,NULL,'A parameter estimation problem is considered, in which dispersed sensors transmit to the statistician partial information regarding their observations.

The starting point is to build on recent progress in the mathematical theory of open Gromov-Witten invariants of orbifolds; we interpret the localization formulae as relating D-brane amplitudes to closed string amplitudes perturbed with twisted masses through an analogue of the \"loop insertion operator\" of matrix models. We first generalize this form of open/closed string duality to general toric backgrounds in all chambers of the stringy Kaehler moduli space; secondly, we display a neat connection of the (gauged) closed string side to tau functions of 1+1 Hamiltonian integrable hierarchies, and exploit it to provide an effective computation of open string amplitudes. In doing so, we also provide a systematic treatment of the change of flat open moduli induced by a phase transition in the closed moduli space. We test our proposal in detail by providing an extensive number of checks. We also use our formalism to give a localization-based derivation of the Hori-Vafa spectral curves as coming from a resummation of A-model disc instantons.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1432738905,1,0),(1118670,670309,'1102.0539','2012-05-07 09\:15\:58','2012-05-08 00\:04\:50',145482,'Daniele Valtorta Mr.','danielevaltorta@gmail.com',31933,'tex','','Sharp estimate on the first eigenvalue of the p-laplacian on compact manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature','Daniele Valtorta','math.DG math.CA','Accepted for publication on Nonlinear Analysis\: TMA (Elsevier).

We find that at least five galaxies can be classified as having pseudobulges. All ten galaxies lie below the \\mbh--L$_{bulge}$ relation, confirming earlier results. Their locus is similar to that occupied by pseudobulges. This leads us to conclude that the growth of BHs in NLS1s is governed by secular processes rather than merger-driven. Active galaxies in pseudobulges point to an alternative track of black hole--galaxy co-evolution. Because of the intrinsic scatter in black hole mass--bulge properties scaling relations caused by a combination of factors such as the galaxy morphology, orientation, and redshift evolution, application of scaling relations to determine BH masses may not be as straightforward as has been hoped.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',2,1432738934,1,0),(1132199,670134,'1102.0364','2012-06-13 11\:12\:51','2012-06-14 00\:02\:24',74037,'Vasant Natarajan','vasant@physics.iisc.ernet.in',584577,'tex','','Conversion between electromagnetically induced transparency and absorption in a three-level lambda system','Sapam Ranjita Chanu, Kanhaiya Pandey, and Vasant Natarajan','physics.optics physics.atom-ph','6 pages, 7 figures',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Europhysics Letters, vol. 98, 44009 (2012)','10.1209/0295-5075/98/44009','We show that it is possible to change from a {\\it subnatural} electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) feature to a {\\it subnatural} electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) feature in a (degenerate) three-level $\\Lambda$ system.

This is shown numerically for an arbitrary crystallographic orientation of the ribbon and proven analytically for zigzag and metallic armchair boundary conditions.

A novel estimating scheme is suggested, according to which each sensor transmits only one-bit messages at stopping times of its local filtration. The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent and, for a large class of processes, asymptotically optimal, in the sense that its asymptotic distribution is the same as the exact distribution of the optimal estimator that has full access to the sensor observations. These properties are established under an asymptotically low rate of communication between the sensors and the statistician. Thus, despite being asymptotically efficient, the proposed estimator requires minimal transmission activity, which is a desirable property in many applications.

Such theory, under appropriate conditions, has been proved to be equivalent to a Lorentzian spacetime structure, where the metric tensor satisfies Einstein field equations. Here, we first recall that according to quantum field theory ideas gravitation is described by a Lagrangian theory of a possible massive graviton field (generated by matter fields and coupling also to itself) living in Minkowski spacetime. The graviton field is moreover supposed to be represented by a symmetric tensor field h carrying the representations of spin two and zero of the Lorentz group. Such a field, then (as it is well known), must necessarily satisfy the gauge condition given by Eq.(3) below. Next, we introduce an ansatz relating h to the 1-form fields g^a. Then, using the Clifford bundle formalism we derive, from our Lagrangian theory, the exact wave equation for the graviton and investigate the role of the gauge condition given by Eq.(3) in obtaining a reliable conservation law for the energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational plus the matter fields in Minkowski spacetime. Finally we ask the question\: does Eq.(3) fix any gauge condition for the field g of the effective Lorentzian spacetime structure that represents the field h in our theory? We show that no gauge condition is fixed a priory, as is the case in General Relativity.

Parallel to the recently presented steady-state thermodynamic formalism for master equation and Fokker-Planck equation, we show that a ``thermodynamic'''' theory can also be developed based on Tsallis'' generalized entropy $S^{(q)}=\\sum_{i=1}^N(p_i-p_i^q)/[q(q-1)]$ and Shiino''s generalized free energy $F^{(q)}=[\\sum_{i=1}^Np_i(p_i/\\pi_i)^{q-1}-1]/[q(q-1)]$, where $\\pi_i$ is the stationary distribution. $dF^{(q)}/dt=-f_d^{(q)}\\le 0$ and it is zero iff the system is in its stationary state. $dS^{(q)}/dt-Q_{ex}^{(q)} = f_d^{(q)}$ where $Q_{ex}^{(q)}$ characterizes the heat exchange. For systems approaching equilibrium with detailed balance, $f_d^{(q)}$ is the product of Onsager''s thermodynamic flux and force. However, it is discovered that the Onsager''s force is non-local. This is a consequence of the particular transformation invariance for zero energy of Tsallis'' statistics.','http\://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/',3,1585699841,1,0);
