Title: Anonymous Oblivious Transfer
Authors: J. Mueller-Quade and H. Imai
Categories: cs.CR
Comments: 6 pages, some things clearified, especially that a broadcast channel
  is not necessary
ACM-class: C.2.0

  In this short note we want to introduce {\em anonymous oblivious transfer} a
new cryptographic primitive which can be proven to be strictly more powerful
than oblivious transfer. We show that all functions can be robustly realized by
multi party protocols with {\em anonymous oblivious transfer}. No assumption
about possible collusions of cheaters or disruptors have to be made.
Furthermore we shortly discuss how to realize anonymous oblivious transfer with
oblivious broadcast or by quantum cryptography. The protocol of anonymous
oblivious transfer was inspired by a quantum protocol: the anonymous quantum
channel.
