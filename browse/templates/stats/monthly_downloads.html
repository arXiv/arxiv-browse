    <p><strong>Caveats:</strong> While we have attempted to extract download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy.
    These factors include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete.</li>
      <li>only web downloads are included (and not FTP or email &quot;downloads&quot; that were formerly supported).</li>
      <li>we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads.</li>
      <li>we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting).</li>
      <lidata prior to 2009 has not been cleaned with as much care as later data, but it shows trends nonetheless.</li>
    </ol>
