  <p>arXiv strives to be open, above all. One of the great challenges to that goal is making diverse scientific papers accessible to assistive technology.</p>
  <p>Are you a researcher who uses a screen reader or other technology to access arXiv, or a professor who helps students do so? We would love to hear from you about the challenges and creative measures you employ to access research on arXiv.

  <h2>How do we make accessible research papers a reality?</h2>
  <p>Can we truly call it "Open Science" when most research papers are not fully accessible? </p>
  <p>On Monday April 17, arXiv is hosting a forum on <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_forum.html">how we can make accessible research papers a reality</a>.
  We all have a role to play. Together, we can chart a path towards truly accessible research papers.</p>
