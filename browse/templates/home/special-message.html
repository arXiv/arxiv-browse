  <p>arXiv strives to be open, above all. One of the great challenges to that goal is making diverse scientific papers accessible to assistive technology.</p>
  <p>Are you a researcher who uses a screen reader or other technology to access arXiv, or a professor who helps students do so? We would love to hear from you about the challenges and creative measures you employ to access research on arXiv.
