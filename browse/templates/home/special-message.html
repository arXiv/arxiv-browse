  <span class="label">Accessible arXiv</span>
  <p>arXiv strives to be open, above all. One of the great challenges to that goal is making diverse scientific papers accessible to assistive technology.</p>
  <p>Are you a researcher who uses a screen reader or other technology to access arXiv, or a professor who helps students do so? We would love to hear from you about the challenges and creative measures you employ to access research on arXiv.

  <h2>How do we make accessible research papers a reality?</h2>
  <p>Can we truly call it "Open Science" when most research papers are not fully accessible? Though registration has ended early due to extremely high interest levels, you can <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_forum.html">learn more about the forum arXiv is hosting</a> on Monday April 17 to chart a path towards truly accessible research papers.</p>
  <p>Recordings of the presentations and panel discussion will be shared after the 17th, along with notes from the breakout discussion groups. Keep an eye out for updates and links.</p>
