"""Domain classes for browse service.

The domain provides a description of the main data objects used in
module APIs. Specifically, the :mod:`browse.controllers` and
:mod:`browse.services` modules should use the domain as their primary
"language". This is intended to make static checking easier and enhance
overall intelligibility of the codebase.
