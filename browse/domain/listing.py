The id is the arXiv ID and may be an idv.

The listing type is one of 'new,'rep','cross','wdr','jref'. These
would be extended with any new types of actions/events that can happen

primary is the primary category of the article.

'''listings is the list of items a time period.

pubdates are the dates of publications. The int is the number of items
published on the associated date.

count is the count of all the items in the listing for the query.

expires is the time at which this data may no longer be cached. It
should be the sort of datetime that could go in an HTTP Expires response
header. It must be in rfc-1123 format ex. Wed, 22 Oct 2008 10:55:46 GMT
The timezone for this expires should be when the cache expires and does not need
to be the timezone of the listing service, listing client or web client.

Why not just do listing: List[Tuple[date,List[ListingItem]}} ?
Because pastweek needs to support counts for the days and needs to be
able to support skip/show.
