A system to analyze informational tension structures in scientific texts using LLMs.

This project aims to integrate a lightweight analysis interface or backend for identifying tension zones, conflicting patterns, and information density layers in scientific writing using large language models. The goal is to help authors and reviewers identify points of interpretive instability or semantic overload.
