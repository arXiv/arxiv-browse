Title: Anonymous Oblivious Transfer
Authors: J. Mueller-Quade and H. Imai
Comments: 5 pages
ACM-class: C.2.0
\\
  In this short note we want to introduce anonymous oblivious transfer a new
cryptographic primitive which can be proven to be strictly more powerful than
oblivious transfer. We show that all multi party protocols can robustly be
realized by anonymous oblivious transfer. No assumption about possible
collusions of cheaters or disruptors have to be made. Furthermore we shortly
discuss how to realize anonymous oblivious transfer with noisy broadcast
channels. The protocol of anonymous oblivious transfer was inspired by a
quantum protocol: the anonymous quantum channel.
